Caraiani (Imperial), <em>The cohomology of Shimura varieties – a survey
of recent developments</em></h1>
<p>For this talk, we’ll focus not on modularity, but instead on some
really fascinating geometric objects that sometimes give you a concrete,
explicit geometric realization of the Langlands correspondence, namely,
Shimura varieties. We’ll thus talk about these fascinating objects and
their many symmetries. There’s been much recent progress in the area.
Towards the end of the talk, we’ll give some high level view on how some
of the different talks at the workshop this week connect to each
other.</p>
<p>To begin, we’ll discuss Shimura varieties.</p>
<h3 id="shimura-varieties">Shimura varieties</h3>
<p>The global Langlands correspondence is supposed to match up different
kinds of data showing up in different contexts. On the harmonic analysis
side, what you see are systems of eigenvalues that show up from the
geometry or topology or analysis of certain highly symmetric spaces.
That’s the perspective from which we’ll approach Shimura varieties.
Later on, on the arithmetic side of the Langlands correspondence, we’ll
see the kind of data that comes from counting solutions to polynomial
equations modulo primes. But for now we’ll focus on spaces with a lot of
symmetry that know about a lot of interesting systems of
eigenvalues.</p>
<p>These spaces will be attached to connected reductive groups <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> (e.g., <span
class="math inline">\(G = {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2\)</span>). We want to look
at the so-called symmetric space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>
for the real points of the group. This is a real manifold endowed with a
Riemannian metric. We can just take <span class="math inline">\(X =
G(\mathbb{R}) / K_\infty^0 A_\infty^0\)</span>. This definition makes
sense over the reals, but we want something to reflect the structure
that we started with over the rational numbers. We get this by taking
quotients. The space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has, by
construction, a left action of <span
class="math inline">\(G(\mathbb{R})\)</span>. If we had, for instance,
started over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, then we
could form the subgroup of integral points <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> inside <span
class="math inline">\(G(\mathbb{R})\)</span>. Shimura varieties are very
roughly the locally symmetric spaces of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma \backslash X\)</span> that arise in this
way. By taking <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> sufficiently
small (e.g., by imposing some congruences conditions), we can ensure
that this quotient has the structure of a smooth real manifold.</p>
<p>This is just a first approximation – Shimura varieties have
additional structure. One first piece of additional structure is what’s
called Hecke symmetry. (This shows up even before you start talking
about Shimura varieties.) Take the finite adelic points <span
class="math inline">\(G(\mathbb{A}_f)\)</span>, given by the restricted
product of the <span class="math inline">\(G(\mathbb{Q}_p)\)</span> for
all primes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Arithmetic groups
essentially arise by taking a small enough compact open subgroup <span
class="math inline">\(K \subset G(\mathbb{A}_f)\)</span>. We then want
to view our locally symmetric space not as a real quotient as above, but
instead as a double quotient <span class="math display">\[X_K =
  G(\mathbb{Q}) \backslash  (X \times G(\mathbb{A}_f)) / K.\]</span>
This is not so far apart from taking a disjoint union of real quotients
as above. More precisely, by strong approximation, we have <span
class="math display">\[G(\mathbb{A}_f) = \sqcup_{
    \substack{
      i \in I  \\
      \text{finite set}      
    }
  }
  G(\mathbb{Q}) \gamma_i K,\]</span> and so <span
class="math display">\[X_K = \sqcup_{i \in I} X / \Gamma_i , \qquad
  \Gamma_i = G(\mathbb{Q}) \cap \gamma_i K \gamma_i^{-1}.\]</span> This
last construction of <span class="math inline">\(X_K\)</span> makes
apparent the full force of symmetries available. The right thing to do
is to consider the inverse limit of these objects <span
class="math inline">\(X_K\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> gets smaller and smaller. (It’s
sometimes useful to restrict to those <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> that are unramified outside some finite
set of primes.) This inverse limit has a natural action of <span
class="math inline">\(G(\mathbb{A}_f)\)</span>. Passing to cohomology,
e.g., <span class="math display">\[\varinjlim_{K} H^\ast(X_K,
\mathbb{C}),\]</span> we retain an action of <span
class="math inline">\(G(\mathbb{A}_f)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can remember the Hecke symmetry at finite level through the action
of a Hecke algebra. Namely, if you just want to look at some fixed
finite level congruence subgroup <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>,
then we can remember the symmetry coming from <span
class="math inline">\(G(\mathbb{A}_f)\)</span> by considering the
corresponding algebra of averaging operators <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{T}\)</span>, called the Hecke algebra. We
then obtain an action <span class="math display">\[\mathbb{T}
\circlearrowright H^\ast(X_K, \mathbb{C}).\]</span></p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>We’ll now give one example and one non-example of Shimura varieties,
followed by the general case.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span id="enumerate:cnpo4gcep4"
label="enumerate:cnpo4gcep4"></span> <span class="math inline">\(G =
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>. The symmetric space is <span
class="math inline">\(X = {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(\mathbb{R}) /
{\mathop{\mathrm{SO}}}_2(\mathbb{R}) \mathbb{R}_{&gt; 0}\)</span>, which
we may identify with the disjoint union <span
class="math display">\[\mathbb{H}^{\pm} = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \Im(z)
&gt; 0 \text{ or } \Im(z) &lt; 0\}\]</span> of upper and lower complex
half-planes. This identification comes from the action <span
class="math display">\[\gamma =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      a      &amp; b \\
      c &amp; d \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \in {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(\mathbb{R}).\]</span> That’s the
symmetric space; how about the locally symmetric space? The <span
class="math inline">\(X_K\)</span> are, by this approximation result,
just disjoint unions of quotients <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma
\backslash \mathbb{H}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma
\subseteq {\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span> is a
<em>congruence subgroup</em>, namely, a finite-index subgroup cut out by
congruence conditions. There’s a famous picture:</p>
<figure id="fig:myimage">
<img src="fund-domain.png" style="width:50.0%" />
<figcaption>Fundamental domain for <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash
\mathbb{H}\)</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This looks like a punctured Riemann sphere, with a cusp at <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> corresponding to the <span
class="math inline">\(y \rightarrow \infty\)</span> limit and some
orbifold-like points around the roots of unity <span
class="math inline">\(\rho = \exp(2 \pi i / 3)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\rho^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, this is a locally symmetric space, but in fact, even more happens
in this example. First of all, these are <em>Riemann surfaces</em>,
hence after compactifying at the cusps, they give rise to smooth
projective curves over the complex numbers. But what’s even more special
is that these curves can be defined by polynomial equations with
<em>rational</em> coefficients.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, Shimura varieties are locally symmetric spaces that
admit an algebraic structure.</p>
<p>A cohomology theory for algebraic varieties is the <span>é</span>tale
cohomology, introduced by Grothendieck roughly 60 years ago. This is
supposed to behave kind of like the singular Betti cohomology for
topological spaces, but should compare while with de Rham cohomology. We
take our curve <span class="math inline">\(S_K\)</span> over the
rational numbers and pass to its realization <span
class="math inline">\(S_K \times_{\mathbb{Q}} \bar{\mathbb{Q}}\)</span>
over the algebraic numbers, then take <span>é</span>tale cohomology with
coefficients in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}\)</span>,
and take the limit over <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[H^\ast
    :=
    \varinjlim H^\ast_K
    :=
    \varinjlim_{K} H_{\acute{e}t}^\ast(S_K \times_{\mathbb{Q}}
\bar{\mathbb{Q}}, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell}).\]</span> This retains the Hecke
symmetry (an action of <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(\mathbb{A}_f)\)</span>) and
a Galois symmetry (an action of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}} /
\mathbb{Q})\)</span>).</p>
<p>Let’s now get even more explicit. Let <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a cusp form of weight <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. It contributes to the cohomology <span
class="math inline">\(H^i\)</span> in degree <span
class="math inline">\(i = 1\)</span>. Writing <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}_f\)</span> for the Hecke ideal
corresponding to the system of eigenvalues attached to <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we can identify <span
class="math inline">\(H^1_K[\mathfrak{m}_f]\)</span> with the Galois
representation attached to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, which
we denote <span id="eq:cnpo4f57z3" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpo4f57z3}\tag{1}
    \rho_{\mathfrak{m}, \ell} : G_{\mathbb{Q}} \rightarrow
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell}).\]</span> We can also
describe <span class="math inline">\(H_K^0\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m} \subseteq \mathbb{T}\)</span> occurs
in it, then the corresponding Galois representation <a
href="#eq:cnpo4f57z3" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpo4f57z3">\((1)\)</a> has the form <span
class="math inline">\(\chi(1 + \chi_{\mathrm{cycl}})\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> is a finite order character of
<span class="math inline">\(G_{\mathbb{Q}}\)</span> and <span
class="math display">\[\chi_{\mathrm{cycl}} : G_{\mathbb{Q}} \rightarrow
\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}\left( \mathbb{Q}(\mu_{\ell^\infty}) / \mathbb{Q}
\right) \cong \mathbb{Z}_{\ell}^\times\]</span> is the cyclotomic
character. Explicitly, if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a
prime with <span class="math inline">\(p \neq \ell\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(\rho_{\mathfrak{m},
\ell}(\mathrm{Frob}_p)\)</span> has eigenvalues <span
class="math inline">\(\{\alpha, \alpha p\}\)</span>. This gives an
example of the general phenomenon that cohomology away from the middle
degree becomes degenerate.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="enumerate:cnpo4gb852"
label="enumerate:cnpo4gb852"></span> We now give a non-example. Take an
imaginary quadratic extension <span class="math inline">\(F =
\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{- d})\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(d
&gt; 0\)</span> is square-free. Take <span class="math inline">\(G =
{\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2 / F\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a symmetric space for <span
class="math inline">\(G(\mathbb{R})\)</span>, which turns out to be
identified with <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{C}) /
{\mathop{\mathrm{SU}}}_2(\mathbb{R})\)</span>, which we may identify
further with hyperbolic <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-space
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{H}^3\)</span>. This has odd real
dimension, hence has no hope of having a complex structure. Thus, here,
<span class="math inline">\(X_K\)</span> are arithmetic hyperbolic <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-manifolds, with no algebraic structure.
That’s the general picture for locally symmetric spaces.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="enumerate:cnpo4ghhcx"
label="enumerate:cnpo4ghhcx"></span> What gave us an algebraic structure
in example <a href="#enumerate:cnpo4gcep4" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="enumerate:cnpo4gcep4">\((1)\)</a> was
that we started with a moduli space of elliptic curves with additional
structure. If we consider now <span class="math inline">\(G :=
{\mathop{\mathrm{GSp}}}_{2 g}\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, then the corresponding
Shimura varieties <span class="math inline">\(S_K\)</span> are moduli
spaces of abelian varieties of dimension <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, with principal polarizations and <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-level structures. There are other
higher rank groups that give rise to Shimura groups, such as unitary
groups, but they are special within the broader realm of reductive
groups. Anyway, the main point is that you have a Galois symmetry in
addition to the Hecke symmetry. These varieties are smooth and
quasi-projective and defined over <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> or some finite extension, and
often, but not always, can be related to a moduli problem of abelian
varieties with extra structure. That’s something that’s very useful in
their study – the ones with this feature are often better understood
than those without. Because they have these additional symmetries, they
are also good test objects for conjectures in arithmetic
geometry.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the rest of the talk, we’ll talk about the feature discussed
above for <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2\)</span>
where the most nondegenerate stuff occurs in middle degree, and away
from that, one sees some degeneration.</p>
<h3 id="intersection-cohomology">Intersection cohomology</h3>
<p>If you want a cohomology theory that is very well-behaved (e.g.,
satisfies Poincare duality) in the setting of varieties that are
quasi-projective but not necessarily projective, then you can work with
something called intersection cohomology. Conjectures of Arthur and
Kottwitz (from more than twenty years ago) predict what the intersection
cohomology <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{IH}^\ast(S_K,
\ast)\)</span> of a Shimura variety should look like, over <span
class="math inline">\(\ast = \mathbb{C}\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}\)</span>. There’s a Lefschetz
structure and a Hodge structure. By looking at the interactions of these
structures, one is led to the expectation that <span
class="math display">\[\operatorname{IH}^{d - k}(S_K, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})
\cong \operatorname{IH}^{d + k}(S_K, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})\]</span> is more
and more degenerate as <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> grows.
Here <span class="math inline">\(d = \dim S_K\)</span>. In
characteristic zero, one can approach these conjectures using known
results toward functoriality.</p>
<p>In the rest of talk, we turn to the question: is there an analogue of
Arthu’s conjecture with torsion coefficients, e.g., for the intersection
cohomology <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{IH}^\ast(S_K,
\mathbb{F}_{\ell})\)</span> with coefficients in a finite field?
Questions of this form have many applications, which will come up in the
research workshop this week. If you can put some nondegeneracy condition
and know that cohomology will be concentrated in the middle degree, then
this can be very useful for proving modularity theorems, the kinds of
results useful for establishing the “other direction” of the Langlands
correspondence. This also plays a role in the prize-winning work of
Newton–Thorne. It also has applications to Euler systems, which are used
to attack the BSD conjecture (Naomi Sweeting’s talk yesterday at the
workshop). This kind of result has also played a key role in advances in
understanding the Langlands correspondence in the Bianchi setting, such
as in work of Caraiani–Newton. It’s also just interesting to see what
the cohomology looks like in the torsion setting, to understand the
analogues of conjectures originally formulated by Langlands.</p>
<p>To end, we’ll describe a sample theorem in the compact case, and
mention some work in progress specifically for intersection cohomology.
We give a sample result, informally stated.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong> (Sample theorem). <em>Assume <span
class="math inline">\(S_K\)</span> is compact. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m} \subseteq \mathbb{T}\)</span> be a
system of Hecke eigenvalues occurring in <span
class="math inline">\(H^\ast(S_K, \mathbb{F}_{\ell})\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span> is sufficiently generic
(representation-theoretic condition at <span class="math inline">\(p
\neq \ell\)</span>, excluding cases like <span
class="math inline">\(\{\alpha, \alpha p\}\)</span> discussed earlier),
then <span class="math display">\[H^\ast(S_K,
\mathbb{F}_{\ell})_{\mathfrak{m}}\]</span> is concentrated in middle
degree <span class="math inline">\(d = \dim S_K\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>We didn’t put attribution here, because it’s a bit complicated. The
strategy for proving this is due to Caraiani–Scholze, then a better
version was put forth by Koshikawa (a speaker on Monday), then an even
stronger version put up last year by Hamann–Lee <a href="#ref-2023arXiv2309.08705" class="citation"
data-cites="2023arXiv2309.08705">(Hamann and Lee 2023)</a>. Results
like this apply to most unitary Shimura varieties, and <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GSp}}}_4\)</span>, but not quite in
general, for various reasons. The modern proof of the theorem uses the
Igusa stack of M. Zhang, extended in work of Daniels–Kim–van
Hoften–Zhang for more general Shimura varieties. When you work over
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic fields, namely, over <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}_p\)</span>, there is a Cartesian
diagram <span class="math display">\[\begin{CD}         
    \mathcal{S}_{K^p}    @&gt;&gt;&gt; \mathcal{H}_{G, \mu}\\
    @VVV  @VVV \\
    \mathrm{Igs} @&gt;\bar{\pi}&gt;&gt; \mathrm{Bun}_G\\
  \end{CD}\]</span> due to work of various authors. (Here <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Igs}\)</span> is the so-called Igusa
stack.) This gives a way to understand cohomology of Shimura varieties
using ideas from the geometric Langlands program. Namely, for
well-behaved sheaves on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Bun}_G\)</span>, one has access to
excursion operators, coming from Fargues–Scholze. This leads to the most
conceptual proof of the sample theorem. The global input that you need
is to know that the relative cohomology <span class="math display">\[R
\bar{\pi}_\ast \mathbb{F}_{\ell}\]</span> is, in some sense, a perverse
sheaf on <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Bun}_G\)</span>. One can
recover <span class="math display">\[\varinjlim_{K_p}
H^\ast(\mathrm{Sh}_{K^p K_p}, \mathbb{F}_{\ell})_{\mathfrak{m}}\]</span>
by applying a Hecke symmetry <span class="math inline">\(T_\mu\)</span>
to <span class="math inline">\((R \bar{\pi}_\ast
\mathbb{F}_{\ell})_{\mathfrak{m}}\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(T_\mu\)</span> is perverse <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-exact on a generic subcategory (coming
from the work of Linus Hamann). These themes will recur in the talks of
Mingjia Zhang and Pol van Hoften.</p>
<p>We conclude by mentioning that in joint work, we are constructing an
intersection complex on the Igusa stack that should recover the
intersection cohomology of Shimura varieties, so you should have a
theorem like the above (for middle degree) but instead for the
intersection cohomology. Depending upon the <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-exactness properties of this Hecke
operator on various subcategories, you could potentially realize the
relative cohomology of the Igusa stack as a global incarnation of the
generalized eigensheaves that showed up in Koshikawa’s talk, and the
analogue of Arthur’s conjectures should be explained by <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-exactness properties on smaller
subcategories.</p>
<div class="remark">
<p><strong>Remark 2</strong>. We understand what the points on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Bun}_G\)</span> look like. For instance,
in <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2\)</span>, the
Igusa stack will reach two points, supersingular and ordinary, and the
fibers will be more complicated objects called Igusa varieties. The
fibers of the map <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\pi}\)</span> are
related to these. What’s really important about the Igusa stack is that
it’s kind of globalizing, giving a way to glue together these objects.
The moduli problem is abelian varieties but up to <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-power isogeny.</p>

Andrea de Cataldo (Stony Brook), <em>The <span
class="math inline">\(P=W\)</span> Conjecture in Non Abelian Hodge
Theory</em></h1>
<p>The topic of the workshop is the <span class="math inline">\(P =
W\)</span> conjecture in non-abelian Hodge theory. The purpose of this
hour is to introduce that conjecture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, we’ll say what non-abelian Hodge theory is.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(P = W\)</span> conjecture then
has two parts: <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(W\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ll then state the conjecture, report on the status of the
conjecture, and give some concluding remarks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Before non-abelian Hodge theory, there is of course abelian Hodge
theory. Today “abelian” refers to <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_1 =
\mathbb{C}^\times\)</span>, while “non-abelian” refers to <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(r &gt; 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a curve, with genus
<span class="math inline">\(g \geq 2\)</span>. The main object today
will be an <span class="math inline">\(H^1\)</span>. In the abelian
case, we’ll get a Lie group, but in the non-abelian case, we won’t get a
Lie group, but we’ll instead get a complex algebraic variety that we’ll
study on its own terms. The <span class="math inline">\(H^1\)</span> of
interest will be <span class="math display">\[H^1(X, \mathbb{C}^\times)
=
  \frac{H^1(X, \mathbb{C})}{H^1(X, \mathbb{Z})}.\]</span> We can think
of this as <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(\pi_1(X),
\mathbb{C}^\times)\)</span> (later, we’ll need to work with an
equivalence relation, but that relation is trivial here because the
group <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_1\)</span> is
abelian). It is isomorphic to <span
class="math inline">\((\mathbb{C}^\times)^{2 g}\)</span>. It is a
complex algebraic variety, and is affine – it can be embedded as a
closed subvariety of some finite-dimensional affine space. We can think
of this further as the character variety <span
class="math inline">\(M_B(X, {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_1)\)</span> (here
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> stands for “Betti”).</p>
<p>There are ways to describe cohomology, and we have the de Rham
theorem. We can view the above quotient as <span
class="math display">\[\frac{H^1_{d R}(X, \mathbb{C})}{H^1(X,
\mathbb{Z})},\]</span> but we can then put connections on <span
class="math inline">\(X \times \mathbb{C}\)</span>, and the above
quotient then identifies with <span
class="math display">\[\frac{  \left( \frac{\text{closed
forms}}{\text{exact forms}} \right)}{
    H^1(X, \mathbb{Z})
  }
  =
  \frac{\text{flat connections on $X \times
\mathbb{C}$}}{\text{gauge}}.\]</span> We can also define <span
class="math inline">\(M_{d R}(X, {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_1)\)</span>. It is
also a complex Lie group, but we want to emphasize that the relation
between these two is not always so simple. There is a biholomorphism
<span class="math display">\[M_{d R}(X, {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_1) \cong
M_B(X, {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_1).\]</span> That is to say, as complex
analytic spaces, these are the same. But if defined correctly, the left
hand side is not affine, while the right hand side is affine. (There are
no polynomial functions on the left, but there are on the right.)</p>
<p>There’s something you can do when you have a connection <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>: you can write it as a closed
connection <span class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span> plus a form <span
class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>, thus <span class="math inline">\(D
= D_0 + \eta\)</span>. There is a canonical metric associated to a flat
connection. From this, we get an essentially canonical harmonic metric
<span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. You can take the</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the real part <span class="math inline">\(\Re(\eta)\)</span> and
its <span class="math inline">\((1,0)\)</span> part, and</p></li>
<li><p>the imaginary part <span class="math inline">\(\Im(\eta)\)</span>
and its <span class="math inline">\((0,1)\)</span> part.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> we extract holomorphic connections
<span class="math display">\[L_{\mathrm{dR}, \nabla^{\mathrm{hol}}},
\quad
  L_{\mathrm{Dol}, a},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a holomorphic <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-form. We obtain <span
class="math inline">\(M_{d R} \rightarrow
\mathop{\mathrm{Jac}}(X)\)</span>, whose fibers are holomorphic <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-forms <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>
<p>We get a vector bundle <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>
given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{CD}
    M_{\mathrm{Dol}}(X,
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_1)    @&gt;&gt;&gt;\mathop{\mathrm{Jac}}(X)\\
    @|  @. \\
    T^\ast \mathop{\mathrm{Jac}}(X) @&gt;&gt;&gt;
\mathop{\mathrm{Jac}}\Omega\\
  \end{CD}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[H^1_{\mathrm{d R}} =
\bar{\Omega} \oplus \Omega = \mathop{\mathrm{Jac}}(X) \times
\Omega.\]</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_{\mathrm{Dol}} \cong
M_{\mathrm{d R}}\)</span> in the smooth category, but not
biholomorphically.</p>
<p>We turn now to <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r\)</span>. We again have an
affine algebraic variety <span class="math display">\[M_B(X,
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r) = \mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(\pi_1,
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r) / \operatorname{conj}
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r.\]</span> There’s also the de Rham side <span
class="math display">\[M_{\mathrm{d R}}(X, {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r) =
  \frac{\text{rank $r$ hol.\ v.\ bundles on $X$}, \nabla : E \rightarrow
E \otimes T_X^\ast}{\text{isom}}.\]</span> The third object is the
Dolbeaut moduli space <span class="math display">\[M_{\mathrm{Dol}}(X,
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r) =
  \frac{\text{rank $r$ hol.\ v.\ bundles on } X, E : \xrightarrow{a} E
\otimes T_X^\ast}{
    \text{isom}
  },\]</span> where now <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is merely
a linear map rather than a connection.</p>
<p>These are three <em>a priori</em> different algebraic varieties (and
indeed, different already in rank one), but bearing the same relations
as in the abelian case. These are singular now, whereas before they were
complex Lie groups. What happens here is that <span
class="math inline">\(M_{\mathrm{d R}}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_{\mathrm{Dol}}\)</span> are canonically
homeomorphic (using that <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is
harmonic, due to Carlette), while <span
class="math inline">\(M_B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_{\mathrm{d R}}\)</span> are biholomorphic, via
holonomy. This is the content of the non-abelian Hodge theorem, due to
Hitchin for <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2\)</span>,
contribution concerning <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> due to
Carlette, putting it together by Carlos Simpson; established in the late
80’s, early 90’s (and established thus far under some non-singularity
assumptions: <span class="math inline">\(d = c_1 E\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\((r, d) = 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>We saw earlier that you can take a Riemann surface <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and study its cohomology group <span
class="math inline">\(H^1(X, \mathbb{C})\)</span> and its various moduli
space <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, which today we study from
the point of view of singular cohomology <span
class="math inline">\(H^\ast(M)\)</span>. The <span
class="math inline">\(P = W\)</span> conjecture is about studying the
singular cohomologies of these spaces when we look at them through the
optics of their different structures.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> stands for “weight”, coming
from the mixed Hodge theory due to Deligne. We consider a smooth
projective manifold <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and work
with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> coefficients. Then
<span class="math display">\[H^k(Y, \mathbb{C}) = \oplus_{p + q = k}
  H^{p, q}(Y),\]</span> which we call a <em>pure weight</em> <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> <em>Hodge structure</em>. Now Deligne
discovered that if we drop “smooth” and “projective” and instead
consider merely quasi-projective <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>,
then the cohomology <span class="math inline">\(H^k(Y,
\mathbb{C})\)</span> does not admit such a decomposition, but admits a
weight filtration <span class="math display">\[W_0 \subset W_1 \subset
\dotsb \subset W_{2 k} = H^k.\]</span> This is functorial with respect
to <span class="math inline">\(Y \rightarrow Y&#39;\)</span>. We get
graded quotients <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{Gr}_w^W H^k
  =
  W_w / W_{w - 1}
  = \oplus_{p + q = w} H^{p, q}.\]</span></p>
<p>For example, consider the variety <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^\times\)</span>. We can then consider
the space <span class="math inline">\(H^1(\mathbb{C}^\times,
\mathbb{C})\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(H^1(\mathbb{C}^\times, \mathbb{Q})\)</span>. In
either case, the space is generated by <span class="math inline">\(d z /
z\)</span>, and coincides with <span class="math inline">\(H^{1,
1}\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(w = 2\)</span>. We can
realize the space as the kernel of <span
class="math display">\[H^2(\mathbb{P}^1)^{\oplus 2} \rightarrow H^2
\mathbb{P}^1.\]</span> Comparing weights suggests why we call this
“mixed”.</p>
<p>To study <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{C}^\times )^{2
g}\)</span>, we can use Kunneth.</p>
<p>We spent a lot of time with the three moduli spaces, but the <span
class="math inline">\(P = W\)</span> conjecture is really about Betti
and Dolbeault, so we now abandon the space <span
class="math inline">\(M_{d R}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, the cohomology of <span class="math inline">\(M_{B}(X,
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r)\)</span> is known to have a relatively simple
structure: <span class="math display">\[H^k(M_B(X,
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r))
  = \oplus_{
    \substack{
      0 \leq w \leq 2 k  \\
      \text{$w$: even}      
    }
  }
  H^{w, w}(M_B).\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2\)</span>:
Hausel–R-Villegas</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r\)</span>:
Shendl</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(W = W_B\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(H(M_B(X, {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r))\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now consider <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> perverse. The
easier way to enter is via <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-modules via the Riemann–Hilbert
correspondence. We can then understand the topology, through the work of
Goresky–Macpherson and BBDG. If you have a morphism of varieties <span
class="math inline">\(h : M \rightarrow A\)</span>, then we get a Leray
filtration of spectral sequences on the singular cohomology <span
class="math inline">\(H(M)\)</span> of the domain. Now let’s pretend
that <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is a fiber bundle, just to
give a face to this filtration. Turn <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> into a cell complex, so that the fiber
bundle is trivial on the cell. Take <span
class="math inline">\(A_K\)</span>, form its preimage <span
class="math inline">\(h^{-1}(A_K)\)</span>, its cohomology, the
restriction map, and its kernel: <span class="math display">\[L = \ker
\left( H^d(M) \rightarrow H^d(h^{-1}(A_K)) \right).\]</span> This is the
standard 1950’s way to look at the Leray spectral sequence. Now, one
reason why we wrote the paper like this is because we are going to
consider a “Hitchin map” from the Dolbeaut moduli space <span
class="math display">\[M_{\mathrm{Dol}} \xrightarrow{h}
\mathbb{C}^{\frac{\dim M}{2}}(E, a),\]</span> where <span
class="math display">\[E \xrightarrow{a} E,\]</span> what’s called the
spectral cover associated with <span class="math inline">\((E,
a)\)</span>. The map <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is proper,
and is equivariant with respect to a certain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^\times\)</span> action. Everything
retracts to zero in such a way that the Leray filtration <span
class="math inline">\(L_h\)</span> is zero. It’s simple to deduce that
the weight filtration on <span
class="math inline">\(W_{\mathrm{Dol}}\)</span> is also trivial.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the cohomology on the Betti moduli space and the
Dolbeault moduli spaces. The isomorphisms between these spaces, given by
the non-abelian Hodge theorem, give isomorphisms between their
cohomology. The <span class="math inline">\(P = W\)</span> conjecture
asks, what corresponds on the Dolbeault side to the filtration <span
class="math inline">\(M_B\)</span> on the Betti side? It can’t be either
<span class="math inline">\(W_{\mathrm{Dol}}\)</span>, or the Leray
filtration <span class="math inline">\(L_h\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(H^{\cdot}(M, \mathbb{Q})\)</span> be formal. There
is a geometric description via the Lefschetz hyperplaen theorem. We can
take the Dolbeaut moduli space and the Hitchin map <span
class="math inline">\(h : M_{\mathrm{Dol}} \rightarrow
\mathbb{C}^N\)</span>. We can restrict this to the preimage <span
class="math inline">\(h^{-1}(\mathbb{C}^k)\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^k \subseteq \mathbb{C}^N\)</span>. This
induces a map in cohomology, whose kernel describes <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[P_p
H^d(M_{\mathrm{Dol}}) = \ker ( H^d(M_{\mathrm{Dol}}) \rightarrow H^d
(h^{-1}(\mathbb{C}^{d-p-1}))).\]</span></p>
<div class="conjecture">
<p><strong>Conjecture 3</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(P =

<p>It seems that this <span class="math inline">\(P = W\)</span>
phenomenon is not just restricted to the contents of the non-abelian
Hodge theorem, but occurs, but work of many people, in different setups,
such as in mirror symmetry, cluster varieties, geometric depth and
combinatorics, and the study of complex hyper Kähler varieties. Somehow
<span class="math inline">\(P = W\)</span> seems to be true in many
cases.</p>
<p>Having stated the conjecture, let’s make some concluding remarks. We
take <span class="math inline">\(\dim X \geq 1\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> a reductive group. In this case, the
varieties are always singular, so the cohomology we’ll work with is

relevant.</p>

Here we note that <span class="math inline">\(4 \exp(-1/80) = 3.9503112

<p>Rather than quasirandomness, they used a delicate elementary approach

all edges with at least one vertex in <span

<p>Let’s quickly look at <span class="math inline">\(R(k, l)\)</span>,
where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is <em>fixed</em>.
Essentially the same arguments as above give <span

<span class="math display">\[k^{5/2} \leq R(4, k) \leq k^3 \text{ up to

that <span class="math inline">\(R(3, k) = k^2 / \log k\)</span> up to a
constant. (Upper bound by Ajtai, Komlos and Szemeredi in 1980, lower
bound by Kim in 1995.) But the <span class="math inline">\(R(4,

<h3 id="arithmetic-progressions-of-length-3">Arithmetic progressions of

<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 7</strong> (Szemeredi, 1975). <em>For every <span

progression of length <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The case <span class="math inline">\(k = 3\)</span> was proved by
Roth in 1953, who showed that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
contains a 3AP if <span class="math inline">\(\delta \geq C / \log \log
n\)</span>. A lot of subsequent work was devoted to improving this bound
(Szemeredi, Heath–Brown, Bourgain, Sanders, Bloom, Schoen), getting to
<span class="math inline">\((\log \log n)^{3 + o(1)} / \log
n\)</span>.</p>
<p>A lower bound of <span class="math inline">\(\exp(- c \sqrt{\log
n})\)</span> proved by Behrend in 1946. Small refinement due to Elkin,
given a simpler proof by Green and Wolf. Recently the constant <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> improved by Elsholtz, Hunter, Proske
and Sauermann. Still leaves a big gap.</p>
<p>7th July 2020: Bloom and Sisask obtained a bound of <span
class="math inline">\(1 /(\log n)^{1 + c}\)</span> for some positive
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<p>10th February 2023: Kelley and Meka improved this to a Behrend-style
bound of <span class="math inline">\(\exp(- c(\log n)^\beta)\)</span>.
We now know that <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> can be taken
to be <span class="math inline">\(1/11\)</span>. The proof was
surprising not that bad.</p>
<h3 id="the-inverse-theorem-for-the-uniformity-norms">The inverse
theorem for the uniformity norms</h3>
<p>One way to prove Szemeredi’s theorem is as follows. Given a subset
<span class="math inline">\(A \subset \{1, \dotsc, n\}\)</span> of
density <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, identify <span
class="math inline">\(\{1, \dotsc, n\}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z} / n  \mathbb{Z}\)</span> and define
<span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[f(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    1 - \delta &amp;  x \in A \\
    - \delta               &amp; \text{ otherwise}.
  \end{cases}\]</span> Then <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
contains roughly the same number of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>APs as a random set (i.e., around <span
class="math inline">\(\delta^k n^2\)</span>) if <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is small in a certain norm, called the
<span class="math inline">\(U^{k - 1}\)</span>-norm.</p>
<p>What does the <span class="math inline">\(U^k\)</span> norm look like
when <span class="math inline">\(k = 3\)</span>? <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  &amp;\lVert f \rVert_{U^3}^8 \\
  &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x, a,b,c}
    f(x) \overline{f(x - a) f(x - b) f(x - c)}
    f(x - a - b)
    f(x - b - c)
    f(x - a - c)
    \overline{f(x - a - b - c)}.
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>We then need to understand what <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (and hence <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>) is like if <span
class="math inline">\(\lVert f \rVert_{U^k}\)</span> is large. For that,
we need <em>inverse theorems</em> for the <span
class="math inline">\(U^k\)</span> norm.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 8</strong> (Weak inverse theorem). <em>If <span
class="math inline">\(\lVert f \rVert_\infty \leq 1\)</span> and <span

</div>
<p>Passing to a subprogression was necessary because of “generalized
polynomials”. (Example: given <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> we
write it as <span class="math inline">\(a + b m\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(m \approx \sqrt{n}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a, b \leq m\)</span>, and then let <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(x) = r a^2 + s a b + t b^2\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Green and Tao gave a precise formulation of “generalized polynomial”
in terms of nilmanifolds in 2006, motivated by the wish to generalize
and strengthen the Green–Tao theorem</p>
<div class="conjecture">
<p><strong>Conjecture 9</strong> (loosely stated). <em>If <span
class="math inline">\(\lVert f \rVert_{U^k}\)</span> is not small, then
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> correlates with a generalized
polynomial phase function.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Green, Tao and Ziegler proved this conjecture in 2010, but their
proof did not give bounds (though in principle, with a lot of work, one
could extract a very weak bound).</p>
<p>In 2018, Manners gave a new proof of the theorem, obtaining a doubly
exponential dependence (of the correlation with the generalized
polynomial phase function on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and
the size of the <span class="math inline">\(U^k\)</span> norm). Already
very notable as the proof introduced many interesting ideas and gave the
first reasonable bound.</p>
<p>28th February 2024: James Leng, Ashwin Sah and Mehtaab Sawhney proved
a <em>quasipolynomial</em> dependence. Oversimplifying slightly, this
gives a dependence of the form <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(c) =
\exp(- \log(1/c)^{\operatorname{O}(1)})\)</span>. This has several
applications, including significantly improved bounds for Szemeredi’s
theorem, and simpler proofs of several other known theorems.</p>
<h3 id="the-expectation-threshold-conjecture">The expectation threshold
conjecture</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a graph with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices. A <em>Hamilton cycle</em> is
an ordering <span class="math inline">\(v_1, \dotsc, v_n\)</span> of the
vertices such that <span class="math inline">\(v_1 v_2, v_2 v_3, \dotsc,
v_{n - 1} v_n, v_n v_1\)</span> are all edges.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a random graph where
each edge is chosen independently with probability <span
class="math inline">\(p =p(n)\)</span>, then how large does <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> have to be before <span
class="math display">\[\mathbb{P}[\text{$G$ contains a Hamilton cycle}]
\geq 1/2?\]</span> KS (Komlos and Szemeredi) showed it’s about <span
class="math inline">\((\log n + \log \log n) / n\)</span>, and a
corresponding “hitting time” result. We call this the <em>threshold
probability</em> for the problem.</p>
<p>Alternatively, what is the expected number of Hamilton cycles if each
edge is chosen with probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>?
The number of cyclic orderings of the vertices is <span
class="math inline">\((n - 1)!\)</span>. Each one has a probability
<span class="math inline">\(p^n\)</span> of giving rise to a Hamilton
cycle. So it is <span class="math inline">\(p^n(n - 1)!\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the probability of having a Hamilton cycle is at least <span
class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>, then the expected number of Hamilton
cycles is at least <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>. Is there
anything resembling a converse to this implication? No obvious reason,
but by staring at examples, one sees that they do seem to be the same up
to logarithmic factors.</p>
<p>A simple back-of-envelope calculation shows that in order for <span
class="math inline">\(p^n(n - 1)!\)</span> to be at least <span
class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>, we need <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to be around <span
class="math inline">\(e /n\)</span>. This is (lying a little) the
<em>expectation threshold</em> for the problem. Since the actual
threshold was about <span class="math inline">\(\log n / n\)</span>, the
expectation threshold is off by a factor <span
class="math inline">\(\log n\)</span>.</p>
<div class="conjecture">
<p><strong>Conjecture 10</strong> (Kahn, Kalai, 2006). <em>For all
monotone graph properties, the threshold is at most <span
class="math inline">\(\log n\)</span> times the expectation

independently with probability <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>threshold</em> for <span

class="math inline">\(p\)</span> at which <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}[A \in \mathcal{F}]\)</span> passes
<span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We say that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span><em>-small</em> if there is a family
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> with the following two
properties.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For each <span class="math inline">\(F \in \mathcal{F}\)</span>,
there exists <span class="math inline">\(G \in \mathcal{G}\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(G \subset F\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We have <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{G \in \mathcal{G}}
p^{\lvert G \rvert} \leq 1/2\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is chosen randomly as
above, then <span class="math display">\[\mathbb{P}[G \subset A] =

<p>The product locus is reminiscent of the boundary geometry of the

satisfying <span class="math inline">\(d &gt; \frac{g - 1 + \sum_{i =

\operatorname{CH}^{d}(\bar{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n},

<p>We start with the following two series: <span

i)!(3 i)!}
  (- T)^{i} = 1 - 60 T + \dotsb,\]</span> and <span

  \frac{1}{2^{h^1(\Gamma)}}

that’s zero (theorem of Pandharipande–Pixto–Zvonkine, 2013). What
remains open is that the conjecture (Pixton, 2012) that these are all
the relations. Pixton’s relations provide the first proposal for the
calculus of the tautological classes (initiated by Mumford in 1983),
parallel to the Schubert calculus.</p>
<p>Pixton’s relations can be restricted to the moduli space <span

<h3 id="pull-back-via-torelli">Pull-back via Torelli</h3>
<p>The Hodge bundle <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E} \rightarrow

lie in the tautological algebra by Mumford’s calculations: <span

  \dim_{\mathbb{Q}} R^\ast(\mathcal{M}_5^c) = 66,\]</span> so <span

imagine this as a tool to test whether your classes lie in the

<p>We return to the simplest question about product cycles on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}_g\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\in^{?} R^{g - 1}(\mathcal{A}_g).\]</span> The
idea is to compute the Torelli pull-back and ask whether we have <span

  \Lambda^{g - 1}(\mathcal{M}_g^{c}).\]</span> A refined statement is
possible:</p>
<div class="proposition">
<p><strong>Proposition 23</strong> (Canning–Oprea–Pandharipande 2022).
<em>If it were the case that <span class="math inline">\([\mathcal{A}_1

(subjunctively), then we must have <span class="math display">\[=

<p>Motivated by this proposition, we define <span
class="math display">\[\Delta_g =[\mathcal{A}_1 \times \mathcal{A}_{g -

  - \frac{g}{6 \lvert B_{2 g} \rvert} \lambda_{g - 1}

an obstruction: <span id="eq:cnpo5ealj6" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpo5ealj6}\tag{2}
  [\mathcal{A}_1 \times \mathcal{A}_{g - 1}] \in R^{g -

do the calculation? We must study the subscheme <span
class="math display">\[{\mathop{\mathrm{Tor}}}^{-1}(\mathcal{A}_1 \times
\mathcal{A}_{g - 1}) \subset \mathcal{M}_g^c.\]</span> The irreducible
components of this are in bijective correspondence with the set <span
class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Part}(g - 1)\)</span> of partitions
of <span class="math inline">\(g - 1\)</span>. The irreducible
components are usually excess dimensional and intersect in a complicated
configuration of strata in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_{g}^{c}\)</span>. (The hardest part is
to understand whether there are any nilpotents. Some very explicit
algebraic geometry.) Doing the excess intersection theory, we find that
<span class="math display">\[{\mathop{\mathrm{Tor}}}^\ast[\mathcal{A}_1
\times \mathcal{A}_{g - 1}] = \sum_{\text{all strata } \Gamma}
\operatorname{Cont}(\Gamma).\]</span> The sum is over all strata, and
<span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Cont}(\Gamma)\)</span> is a

totally explicit mathematics.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to check whether the Torelli pullback is in

\Delta_g =^? 0 \in R^{g - 1}(\mathcal{M}_g^{c}).\]</span> We do this
using <code>Admcycles</code> (a SAGE package which calculates in the

class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>
modular form of weight <span class="math inline">\(2 g\)</span> with
coefficients in the Chow group <span
class="math inline">\(\operatorname{CH}^{g - 1}(\mathcal{A}_g)\)</span>
for <span class="math inline">\(g \geq 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We propose to unite these conjectures:</p></li>
<li><p><u>Modularity Conjecture III</u>: For <span
class="math inline">\(g \geq 2\)</span>, there is a unique isomorphism
<span class="math display">\[\phi_g : \mathrm{N L}_{g} \rightarrow
\mathrm{Mod}_{2 g}^\ast\]</span> that satisfies the property <span
class="math display">\[f = \sum_{d = 0}^\infty f \circ \phi_g
\left([\tilde{\mathrm{N L}}_{g, d}] \right) q^{d}\]</span> for every
modular form <span class="math inline">\(f \in \mathrm{Mod}_{2
g}\)</span>. (There’s even less evidence for this, but it’s the simplest
possible explanation for the previous two.)</p>
<p>The conjectures are not just about tautological classes:</p></li>
<li><p><u>Theorem</u> (Iribar Lopez 2024): We have <span
class="math inline">\([\mathrm{N L}_{g, d}] \notin R^{g -
1}(\mathcal{A}_g)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(d \in \{1,
2\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g = 12\)</span> and all
even <span class="math inline">\(g \geq 16\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Several directions remain open. For instance, try to use knowledge of
these classes to generate all the interesting nonvanishing in Pixton’s
conjecture. That’s still somehow a pipe-dream; it worked in that one
case, but we don’t know how to do it in general.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 28</strong> (Iribar Lopez–Pandharipande–H.-H. Tseng
2024). <em>In the genus <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> quantum
cohomology of the Hilbert scheme <span
class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Hilb}(\mathbb{C}^2, d)\)</span> of
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> points in the plane, we have the
evaluation <span class="math display">\[\left\langle(2)
\right\rangle_1^{\operatorname{Hilb}(\mathbb{C}^2, d)}
    = \frac{1}{24}
    \frac{(t_1 + t_2)^2}{ t_1 t_2}
    \left( {\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}}_d + \sum_{k = 2}^{d}
      \frac{\sigma_1(d - k)}{ d - k}
{\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}}_k\right).\]</span> Here <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}}_k\)</span> is the trace of
the operator of genus <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> quantum
multiplication by <span class="math inline">\(c_1(\mathcal{O} /

class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Hilb}(\mathbb{C}^2,
k)\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The theorem is connected to the calculation <span
class="math display">\[\operatorname{taut}([\mathrm{N L}_{g, d}]) =
  \frac{d^{2 g - 1} g}{ 6 \lvert B_{2 g} \rvert}
  \prod_{p \mid d}

GW/DT correspondence for families of local curves, Hodge integrals for
families of elliptic curves, and a GW/NL correspondence for <span

Greer–Lian.</p>

<p>Fix <span class="math inline">\(p \geq 5\)</span> and <span

with ring of integers <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>
and residue field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}\)</span>. Let
<span class="math inline">\(\zeta : G_{\mathbb{Q}_p} \rightarrow
\mathcal{O}^\times\)</span> be trivial (or <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>, the cyclotomic character, if
you want). It will play the role of a central character.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> denote the
category of smooth representations of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, with central character <span
class="math inline">\(\zeta\)</span>, on locally torsion <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>-modules, i.e., any element of
the module is killed by some <span
class="math inline">\(p^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>We denote by <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> the
“<span class="math inline">\(E G\)</span> stack” parametrizing families
of projective rank <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>
<span>é</span>tale <span class="math inline">\((\varphi,

class="math inline">\(\gamma_a(1 + \tau) =(1 + \tau)^a\)</span>. Here
“family” means family over a <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adically complete <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>-algebra. To match the central
character condition, we’ll have a determinant condition. The determinant
of our rank two <span class="math inline">\((\varphi,

class="math inline">\((\varphi, \Gamma)\)</span>-module, and we want
this determine to be to be <span class="math inline">\(\zeta

<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong> (Dotto–Emerton–Gee). <em>There exists a
fully faithful functor <span class="math display">\[\mathfrak{a} : D_{f
.g.}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathcal{A}) \hookrightarrow
D_{\mathrm{coh}}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathfrak{X}).\]</span></em></p>
</div>
<div class="remark">
<p><strong>Remark 2</strong>. It might be that what we’ve written
doesn’t characterize the functor. We don’t claim that there is a unique
functor. It is going to satisfy certain properties. We don’t know that
they characterize it, but it is in some sense reasonable. Maybe at first
it’s a bit hard to see what we mean at all, but a very rough idea is
that an object in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>,
which is a smooth representation, well, one could at least think of a
smooth representation that is not irreducible (or at least admissible)
as some family, or integral, of representations that are irreducible (or
admissible). There is a classical mod <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> Langlands that relates irreducible mod
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> representations (the building
blocks in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>) to
semisimple mod <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-dimensional Galois representations of
<span class="math inline">\(G_{\mathbb{Q}_p}\)</span>, which are somehow
closed points in <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>. So
the building block of the functor will be that the building blocks in
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> go to some sort of
skyscrapers in <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>, and a
typical element of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> will
be some direct integral of building blocks, while a typical element of
<span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> will be a direct
integral of its fibers. That’s how you’re supposed to imagine this
functor going.</p>
</div>
<p>When you have a derived category and put a subscript at the bottom
(indicating cohomologies in a subcategory), this condition should be a
reasonably behaved one for this notion to give you a reasonable
subcategory. One would want to know that “finitely generated” is a
reasonable condition to put on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>-modules. There’s kind of a
fact which is that in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>,
“finitely generated” is equivalent to “finitely presented”. So <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> has a kind of “Noetherian”
nature. We want to say a bit more about this, partly to introduce more
notation and concepts, but also, it’s clear what it means for a
representation to be finitely generated, but less so for finitely
presented in this setting, since <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> is not a category of modules
over a ring. So let’s say a bit more about what “finitely presented”
means here. The building blocks of the finitely generated modules are
the <em>free</em> finite rank modules. The corresponding building blocks
in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span></p>
<p>If you have a finitely generated element of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>, so it’s some <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-representation with a finite number of
generators, then what you can do is you can act using <span
class="math inline">\(K = {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z}_p)\)</span>
and the center <span class="math inline">\(Z \leq G\)</span> (which just
acts by the scalar <span class="math inline">\(\zeta\)</span>) and act
on your finitely many generators with <span class="math inline">\(K
Z\)</span>. This will give you a finitely-generated <span
class="math inline">\(K Z\)</span> module, but since the representation
is smooth, you’ll actually get a finite <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>-module. A typical finitely
generated <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> module will be
generated over <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> by some finite
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>-module <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, which is a representation of <span
class="math inline">\(K Z\)</span>. So what you can do is, your
representation that you’re thinking about will be a quotient of a
compact induction <span id="eq:cnpp1dqjrk" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpp1dqjrk}\tag{1}
  {\mathop{\mathrm{ind}}}_{K Z}^{G} V \twoheadrightarrow \pi.\]</span>
Thus such compact inductions are the building blocks of the finitely
generated representations. Now <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>
being “finitely presented” is equivalent, by definition if you’d like,
to the kernel of the map <a href="#eq:cnpp1dqjrk"
data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1dqjrk">\((1)\)</a> being finitely
generated. (We note that if it is true for one such <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, it will be true for all <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span>.) It’s true for <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)\)</span> that
finitely generated implies finitely presented (by Berthel–Livre (?) and
Breuil), but that’s not an obvious fact, nor a general one (e.g., it
fails for <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2\)</span>
over a quadratic extension of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}_p\)</span>).</p>
<p>We want to come back to these representations in a little bit, but
first, let’s say what we mean by coherent. <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> is a formal algebraic stack,
and is in fact Noetherian, so you can write it as an increasing union,
or colimit, of algebraic stacks <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}_n\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\mathfrak{X} = \operatorname{colim}_n
\mathfrak{X}_n.\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}_n
\hookrightarrow \mathfrak{X}_{n + 1}\)</span> are closed immersions,
which we can think of as a “thickening”. You can push forward a coherent
sheaf on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}_n\)</span> to think of
it as a coherent sheaf on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}_{n +
1}\)</span>, so you can take the colimit of those maps at the level of
derived categories: <span
class="math display">\[D_{\mathrm{coh}}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathfrak{X}) :=
  \operatorname{colim}_n
D_{\mathrm{coh}}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathfrak{X}_n).\]</span> You have to be a
bit careful thinking about such things, however. For instance, the
structure sheaf <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_{\mathfrak{X}}\)</span> is
<em>not</em> coherent (by this definition). The structure sheaf <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_{\mathfrak{X}_n}\)</span> <em>is</em>
a coherent sheaf on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>,
and so <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_{\mathfrak{X}}\)</span>
is kind of an inverse limit <span class="math inline">\(\varinjlim_n
\mathcal{O}_{\mathfrak{X}_n}\)</span>, so in our framework, it will be a
<em>pro-</em>coherent sheaf, but not itself a coherent sheaf: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{O}_{\mathfrak{X}} =  \varinjlim_n
\mathcal{O}_{\mathfrak{X}_n} \in \operatorname{Pro}
  D_{\mathrm{coh}}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathfrak{X}).\]</span></p>
<p>So that’s at least some slight orientation about what the categories
are. Now what we’d like to say is, how would you produce such a
functor?</p>
<p>We should have said earlier that one key property of this functor
<span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{a}\)</span> is that it is
<em>exact</em>, i.e., preserves distinguished triangles. We actually use
the language of stable <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>
categories rather than derived categories, which offers some technical
advantages, but in the language of derived categories, we certainly want
the property of exactness. This functor will not be <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> exact</p>
<p>There are abelian categories <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> underlying <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>, but these will not be
preserved by our functor, so working with derived categories is out of
necessity. But if we were working with such abelian categories, say
thinking of them as categories of modules over a ring, we could try to
understand functors between them by understanding where the ring goes.
What you discover is that any such functor is given by some sort of
tensor, which you might call the <em>kernel</em> of such a functor (in
the sense of an integral kernel). So if you’re given a functor and want
to find the kernel, you just apply the functor to the ring, and this
gives you the kernel to describe the functor in general. This gives a
clue as to how you should think of this functor, but like we said, it’s
not the category of modules over a ring. Why not? Well, roughly for two
reasons. What would the ring be? Well, you’re looking at the category of
representations of a group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, so
it’d be the category of modules over the group ring of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, but why isn’t it that? Well, roughly,
we’re looking at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-power torsion
modules, but not with any bounded amount of torsion necessarily, so the
only coefficient ring that would make sense is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>, but we’re not allowed to
take <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}[G]\)</span> itself or even
the trivial representation of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> on
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span> as a module of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, because <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O} [G]\)</span> acts on modules that are
too <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adically big to be in our
category, but also there’s no continuity condition built into that group
ring, so that group ring acts on representations that are not continuous
or smooth, so it doesn’t take into account the topology.</p>
<p>So again, any finitely generated module is killed by some <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O} / p^n\)</span>, and then you might
have your group <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and in fact <span
class="math inline">\(K Z\)</span> acting (with <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> acting via <span
class="math inline">\(\zeta\)</span>), and then some <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> that is open and normal in <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> might be acting trivially because the
action is smooth, so the group algebra <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{O} / p^n[K Z / H]_\zeta\]</span> would
be acting, but then the group ring of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> would act compatibly with the group
ring of <span class="math inline">\(K Z\)</span>, leading to <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{O}[G]_\zeta  \otimes_{  \mathcal{O}[K
Z]_\zeta }  \mathcal{O} / p^n[K Z / H]_\zeta
  = {\mathop{\mathrm{ind}}}_{K Z}^G \mathcal{O} / p^n[K Z /
H]_\zeta,\]</span> and then we might take an inverse limit, giving <span id="eq:cnpp1gy22u" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpp1gy22u}\tag{2}
  \mathcal{O}[[G]]_\zeta
  =
  \varprojlim
  \widehat{\mathcal{O}[G]_\zeta  \otimes_{  \mathcal{O}[K Z]_\zeta
}  \mathcal{O} / p^n[K Z / H]_\zeta }
  = \widehat{{\mathop{\mathrm{ind}}}_{K Z}^G \mathcal{O}[[K
Z]]_\zeta}.\]</span> So it’s this inverse limit of the gadgets that were
used for checking “finitely presented”. You can either think of this as
literally the inverse limit of a topological ring, or as a formal
inverse limit – not an object of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>, but an object of <span
class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Pro} \mathcal{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>So again, if we actually were looking at the category of modules over
a ring, this would be projective over that, but instead it’s a
projective pro-generator. In fact, it is the case that this category
fully faithfully embeds in the category of finitely presented modules
over this last ring <a href="#eq:cnpp1gy22u" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1gy22u">\((2)\)</a>. The key thing is
that, to the extent that our category <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> is a category of modules over
anything, it is a category of modules over this ring <a
href="#eq:cnpp1gy22u" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1gy22u">\((2)\)</a>, and so to find a
kernel, we should apply our functor to this ring, leading us to consider
<span class="math display">\[L_\infty := \mathfrak{a} \left(
\mathcal{O}[[G]]_\zeta \right).\]</span> Applying our functor to this
pro-object should lead to another pro-object. One of the first
properties (not obvious) is that what this will give will be a
pro-coherent sheaf (rather than a pro-complex). The name <span
class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> goes back to a paper (with
Caraiani, Gee, Shin, others) studying patching, where we posited a
hypothetical true <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic local
Langlands object; “<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>” was chosen
because it came next to “<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>” in the
alphabet.</p>
<p>The Morita-theoretic yoga we were just recalling is that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{a}\)</span> is given by <span
class="math display">\[\pi \mapsto L_\infty
\otimes_{\mathcal{O}[[G]]_\zeta} \pi.\]</span> Here <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is an object of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>, or more generally <span
class="math inline">\(D_{\mathrm{fg}}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathcal{A})\)</span>.
You can resolve <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> by considering
free modules over this ring or via compact inductions at finite levels.
If you just resolve <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> by finitely
presented modules over this ring (which you can do), then you just get
copies of <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span>, which is a
pro-object. So something you have to prove is that you actually land in
coherent sheaves when you put in a <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, rather than just pro-coherent
sheaves. Note that <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> is
pro-coherent (rather than coherent), so this is something special about
<span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<p>Okay, but first, we have to know what <span
class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> actually is. For this, you have
to guess. It’s given by the ideas of Colmez, who explained how to
convert <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-dimensional Galois
representations into representations of <span
class="math inline">\(G_{\mathbb{Q}_p}\)</span> (a rather small object
of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>). He did it by a
formula: take your Galois rep, turn it into a <span
class="math inline">\((\varphi, \Gamma)\)</span>-module <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, then take <span
class="math display">\[D^{\natural} \otimes _{\zeta \varepsilon^2}
\mathbb{P}^1.\]</span> (This is notation Colmez introduced.) Here <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P} ^1\)</span> has an action of <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)\)</span>. We
do this for the universal <span class="math inline">\((\varphi,
\Gamma)\)</span>-module over <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>. That is to say, our stack
has a universal <span class="math inline">\((\varphi,
\Gamma)\)</span>-module, and we check that we can implement Colmez’s
construction naturally, producing this object.</p>
<p>What this object will look like is sort of, if this formal stack
<span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> were some formal
spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Spf} A\)</span> of
some ring <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (say locally in the
fppf topology), then the <span class="math inline">\((\varphi,
\Gamma)\)</span>-module is some finite rank module over something like
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}\)</span>, but with
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_p\)</span> replaced by this other
algebra <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Then, roughly, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> looks like a power series
ring. So if you’re on a chart on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Spf} A\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> is roughly <span
class="math inline">\(A[[T]]\)</span>. So we’re already seeing the
coefficients <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (which is a bit like
the structure sheaf of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>, pro just along the formal
directions in <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>) but
also this <span class="math inline">\([[T]]\)</span>, which is another
pro direction. That’s the pro nature of this <span
class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>Having produced this <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span>,
it’s not clear that the resulting functor does anything that you want,
e.g., that it lands in <span
class="math inline">\(D_{\mathrm{coh}}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathfrak{X})\)</span>
rather than some more pro version, and it’s not clear that it’s fully
faithful. So to study this functor, we need some tools. We want to
conclude the talking by saying what those tools are. For that, we need
to come back to <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>, which
we recall is this stack of <span class="math inline">\((\varphi,
\Gamma)\)</span>-module. Fontaine tells us that if we take a point of
<span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> over some (literally)
finite <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>-algebra, that’s
a rank two <span class="math inline">\((\varphi,
\Gamma)\)</span>-module, then this gives a Galois representation. So if
you probe <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> with small
rings, you get Galois representations. But if you probe <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> with <em>big</em> rings, you
get stuff that’s too big. But somehow <span
class="math display">\[\mathfrak{X}[\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}]
  \leftrightarrow
  \bar{\rho} : G_{\mathbb{Q}_p} \rightarrow
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}).\]</span> Now <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> is an algebraic stack, so it
has these <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}\)</span>-points (what you
might call “finite type” points), which, if it were a variety, would be
the closed points, but here we have an Artin rather than Deligne–Mumford
stack, so such points are not in general closed, but instead specialize
to semisimplifications. Thus the semisimple <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\rho}\)</span>’s correspond to the closed
<span class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}\)</span>-points:
<span
class="math display">\[\mathfrak{X}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})_{\mathrm{closed}}
  \leftrightarrow \bar{\rho}^{\mathrm{ss}}.\]</span></p>
<p>There’s another thing, a scheme <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (that will in the minute be a formal
scheme over <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Spf}
\mathcal{O}\)</span>), such that <span
class="math inline">\(X(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})\)</span> is in
bijection with <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})_{\mathrm{closed}}\)</span>.
The underlying reduce scheme <span
class="math inline">\(X_{\mathop{\mathrm{red}}}\)</span> will be a chain
of copies of the projective line, where the number of them is <span
class="math inline">\(\tfrac{p \mp 1}{2}\)</span>, where the sign is
given by <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(- 1) = \pm 1\)</span>. What
we claim is that semisimple Galois representations naturally arrange
themselves in this way. It’s an observation that in some sense goes back
to computations in the beginning of this century that were later brought
out in conversations of Berget and Breuil, and partly pointed out by
Kisin, but kind of carefully noted and promoted to thinking you could
really think about by Emerton and Gee, as part of this <span
class="math inline">\(E G\)</span> stack, and so we’ll maybe tell you
how this goes, at least briefly.</p>
<p>We’ll be looking at the reduction <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{\varepsilon}\)</span> of our cyclotomic
character mod <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Maybe we’re
looking at a direct sum of two characters, say <span id="eq:cnpp1hxgb1" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpp1hxgb1}\tag{3}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    w_\alpha \cdot \bar{\varepsilon}^i    &amp;  \\
                                   &amp; w_{\alpha^{-1}} \cdot
\bar{\varepsilon}^{-(i + 1)} \\
  \end{pmatrix}.\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is
a discrete variable, while <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
lives in some <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{G}_m\)</span>. This
kind of a thing is a common thing you’ll see in number theory talks on
Galois representations. A general principle in mathematics, going back
at least to Arabic algebraists (pre-Renaissance), is that a piece of
notation can refer either to a number or a variable, and this leads to
the idea of the <span class="math inline">\(E G\)</span> stack, which is
that <a href="#eq:cnpp1hxgb1" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1hxgb1">\((3)\)</a> should really be a
family of things. Now, what happens if you let <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> go to <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>? There’s a natural way to think
about it coming from the theory of reduction of crystalline theorems (or
Serre’s conjectures, etc). If you send <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, then the above will go to an
irreducible induction, then take the inverse to get what happens near
<span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>So what we said is tha tthe closed points of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> are in bijection with these
semisimple guys, and once you know that, there’s a unique way to produce
a morphism of underlying topological spaces, <span
class="math display">\[\lvert \mathfrak{X} \rvert \rightarrow \lvert X
\rvert,\]</span> once you’ve matched the closed points. Then you can
essentially push forward the structure sheaf on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> to get a structure sheaf
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X = f_\ast
\mathcal{O}_{\mathfrak{X}}\)</span> under <span class="math inline">\(f
: \mathfrak{X} \rightarrow X\)</span>. By Paskunas, semisimple <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\rho}\)</span> correspond to <em>blocks</em>
of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> that are locally admissible
(colimits of admissible). One can make the following:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 3</strong>. Given a closed subset <span
class="math inline">\(Y \hookrightarrow \lvert X \rvert\)</span>, we
define <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{A}_Y := \left\{
      \begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
        \pi \in \mathcal{A} : \text{all nonzero subquotients} \\
        \text{of $\pi$ lie in blocks} \\
        \text{induced by $Y \in \mathcal{Y}$}
      \end{array}
    \right\} \subseteq \mathcal{A}.\]</span> We then define, for <span
class="math inline">\(U := \lvert X \rvert - Y\)</span>, the quotient
<span class="math display">\[\mathcal{A}_U := \mathcal{A} /
\mathcal{A}_Y.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>We then have the following result <span class="citation"
data-cites="2022arXiv2207.04671">(<strong>2022arXiv2207.04671?</strong>,
Theorem 1.1.1)</span>:</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 4</strong> (DEG). <em><span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{\mathcal{A}} : U \mapsto A_U\)</span> is a

\tilde{\mathcal{A}}) = \mathcal{A}\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Now for <span class="math inline">\(x \in
X(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})\)</span>, we have a formal substack <span
class="math inline">\(D_{\mathrm{fg}}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathcal{A}_x)
\xrightarrow{\mathfrak{a}} D_{\mathrm{fg}}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathfrak{X}_x
)\)</span>. In characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>,
you can thicken up pseudorepresentations, but not deform them
nontrivially. These sort of stacks were first studied by
Carl(?)–Wang–Erickson. Using Colmez–Paskunas’s work, and then the work
of Johansson–Newton–Wang–Erickson, we can rewrite <span
class="math display">\[\mathfrak{a}
|_{D_{\mathrm{fg}}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathcal{A}_x)}\]</span> in terms of
Colmez’s functors, and then using the mentioned work in this rewritten
form, we deduce that this functor is fully faithful. This version of the
functor was thus already studied in somewhat disguised form by those
authors. We thus have some “fully faithfulness” available. With that in
hand, our arguments need to combine with this localization theory and
diagrams like <span class="math display">\[\begin{CD}         
    D^{\mathrm{b}}_{\mathrm{fg}}(\mathcal{A})    @&gt;
\mathfrak{a}&gt;&gt; D_{\mathrm{coh}}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathfrak{X})\\
    @VVV  @VVV \\
    D_{\mathrm{fg}}^{\mathrm{b}} @&gt;&gt; \mathfrak{a}_U&gt;
D_{\mathrm{coh}}^{\mathrm{b}}(f^{-1}(U)).\\
  \end{CD}\]</span> to get to the whole setting. That’s roughly how we
prove the theorem.</p>
<p>We note that nearly everything in the proof is specific to <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)\)</span>, in
a very fundamental way.</p>
<div class="remark">

<h1
id="andrew-wiles-university-of-oxford-non-abelian-descent-and-modularity">Andrew
Wiles (University of Oxford), <em>Non-abelian descent and
modularity</em></h1>
<p>So I’ve been thinking for a long time now about how to prove
modularity more generally. Modularity lifting is in very good shape,
whereas proving residual modularity is much more hard, and besides the
theorem of Khare and Wintenberger, there isn’t something very general.
Seems extremely difficult to generalize Khare–Wintenberger directly, so
I’ve been trying to take the approach using potential modularity, which
is known quite generally. Suppose you have a representation (<span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>-adic, or a compatible system) <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, over some totally real field <span
class="math inline">\(F_0\)</span>. You know that if you take some
not-necessarily-solvable totally real field <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(F_0\)</span>, passing from <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{\rho}\)</span>, then you can find an
automorphic form <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that corresponds
to <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\rho}\)</span>. This <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> will be invariant (since <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{\rho}\)</span> comes from <span
class="math inline">\(F_0\)</span>), and the question then arises: does
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> equal to the lift <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}_0\)</span> of some <span
class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>? Namely, can we find the <span
class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(F_0\)</span> such that the natural diagram
commutes? That will be a way of finding modularity. Thus, potential
modularity reduces the problem to descent, but unfortunately, it’s
nonsolvable descent.</p>
<p>One example where we can do this is cyclic base change, where we do
get descent, but cyclic base changes depends upon the trace formula, and
this works in contexts where you have (inner) forms or a group, or when
you have a subgroup given by invariance under one element, as is the
case for cyclic base change. For non-solvable base change, invariance is
much more subtle, so we trade one problem for a much harder one.</p>
<p>What we’re going to do is cyclic base change in a slightly different
context from normal and see how to replace the arguments in that.</p>
<p>Let’s take <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F_0\)</span> totally real number fields. We’re
going to assume that <span class="math inline">\(F / F_0\)</span> is a
cyclic extension, with Galois group generated by some element <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. (This generality is sufficient
for what we want to use it for.) We assume moreover that <span
class="math inline">\(F / F_0\)</span> is unramified. Let <span
class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span> be a quaternion algebra over <span
class="math inline">\(F_0\)</span> that is ramified at all the infinite
places and unramified at the finite ones. To do this, we need to assume
that <span class="math inline">\([F_0 : \mathbb{Q}] \equiv 0
\pmod{2}\)</span>. This restriction on the finite places is not really
essential, but as we’ll explain later, there’s a reason why we wanted to
include it.</p>
<p>We then form a Shimura variety (really a set) <span
class="math display">\[X_0 := X_0(U_0) =
  D_0^\times \backslash D_{0, f}^\times  / U_0,\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(D_0^\times\)</span> is the
multiplicative group of our quaternion algebra,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(D_{0, f}^\ast\)</span> is its group
of finite adelic points, and</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(U_0\)</span> is some level structure,
say <span class="math inline">\(U_0 = U_0(\mathfrak{n}_0)\)</span>
(“<span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_0(\bullet)\)</span>” structure)
with <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{n}_0\)</span>
square-free.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We then have a space <span class="math display">\[S(U_0) = \left\{ f
: X_0(U_0) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}  \right\}.\]</span> It might seem like
this is a very simple structure, but it carries the action of the Hecke
operators in the usual way, and moreover, by the theorem of
Jacquet–Langlands and Shimizu, this <span
class="math inline">\(S(U_0)\)</span> is isomorphic as a Hecke module to
the space of weight two Hilbert modular forms of level <span
class="math inline">\(U_0\)</span>. I’m going to work with these spaces
instead of with <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2\)</span> and Hilbert
modular forms. From the point of view of the trace formula, basically
we’re focusing on the elliptic elements in the trace formula. I think
one could do this for <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2\)</span> instead, but it’s
simpler and easier to handle if we do it in this context.</p>
<p>Let’s turn to the trace formula. Trace of what? Let <span
class="math inline">\((\pi_0) \subseteq \mathcal{O}_{F_0}\)</span> be a
prime that splits completely in <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>,
thus <span class="math inline">\(\pi_0 = \prod_i
\pi^{\sigma^i}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\((\pi)
\subseteq \mathcal{O}_F\)</span>. What we want to compute is the trace
on the space of forms here. We’re going to consider the vector space
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}[X_0]\)</span>, which has two
important bases:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span id="enumerate:cnpp1no6c8"
label="enumerate:cnpp1no6c8"></span> <span
class="math inline">\(X_0\)</span> itself, given characteristic
functions of points <span class="math inline">\(t_{0, i}\)</span>,
and</p></li>
<li><p><span id="enumerate:cnpp1npes7"
label="enumerate:cnpp1npes7"></span> a basis of eigenforms <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_0\)</span> for the Hecke
operators.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What we want to compute is the trace of <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\pi_0}\)</span>. We can express this
analytically in terms of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_0\)</span>, and geometrically in terms
of the points. We write this as <span
class="math display">\[\mathop{\mathrm{trace}}T_{\pi_0}
|_{\mathcal{F}_0}
  = \lvert T_{\pi_0} \cdot \Delta_{X_0} \rvert,
  \qquad
  \Delta_{X_0} = \Delta \subset X_0 \times X_0.\]</span></p>
<p>What we need to do is to relate the trace of <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\pi_0}\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_0\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\pi}\)</span> acting on the space of invariant
forms over <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. But the way of
getting from <span class="math inline">\(X_0\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is going to be via the geometric side.
So we want to understand what this set <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\pi_0} \cdot \Delta_{X_0}\)</span> is.</p>
<p>So, what is an element <span class="math inline">\(Q \in
T_{\pi}\)</span>? We pick some <span class="math inline">\(t_{0,
i}\)</span>, some coset representative <span
class="math inline">\(\varpi_{\pi_0}\)</span>, and we write <span
class="math display">\[t_{0, i} \varpi_{\pi_0 } = \gamma_0 t_{0, i}
u_0,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_0 \in
D_0^\times\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_0 \in
U_0\)</span>. So we get some expression like that, and reading off from
this, we can see for instance that <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_0\)</span> has determinant (or norm) of the
same ideal as <span class="math inline">\(\pi_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>So associated to this <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, we have
some <span class="math inline">\(t_{0, i}\)</span> (some representative
of <span class="math inline">\(X_0\)</span>) and an element <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_0\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(D_0^\times\)</span>. It moreover satisfies a
quadratic equation over <span class="math inline">\(F_0\)</span>, so it
actually lies in some quadratic extension <span
class="math display">\[L_0 = F_0(\gamma_0).\]</span> That quadratic
extension is necessarily CM (coming from the fact that <span
class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span> is ramified at all infinite
places).</p>
<p>Now, what we want to do is associate a similar kind of thing over
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. So, to get over <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> from the element <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_0\)</span>, we choose <span
class="math display">\[\gamma \in L = F(\gamma_0)\]</span> so that <span id="eq:cnpp1n6c66" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpp1n6c66}\tag{4}
  \mathcal{N}_{L / L_0}(\gamma) = \gamma_0.\]</span> (Because it’s a
cyclic extension, class field theory tells you that you only need to
check this locally. It’s easy to see from our construction and Hasse’s
theorem that such a <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> exists.)
In view of <a href="#eq:cnpp1n6c66" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1n6c66">\((4)\)</a>, it’s easy to see
that <span class="math display">\[(\gamma) = \mathfrak{b}^{\sigma - 1}
\mathfrak{p},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n(\mathfrak{p})
=(\pi)\)</span> is a prime divisor of <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, lying above the corresponding
factorization of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_0\)</span>. So we
have a prime factorization like this and can turn it back into adelic
language. If we pick adelic representatives for the ideals, then we can
write this as <span class="math display">\[\beta^\sigma \omega_{\pi} =
\gamma \beta u.\]</span> Now, what does this say? Thinking about it, it
gives us an element of <span class="math inline">\(T_\pi \sigma \cdot
\Delta_X\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(X = X(U_0)\)</span>
is defined like <span class="math inline">\(X_0\)</span>, but now over
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, in terms of <span
class="math inline">\(D = D_0 \otimes_{F_0} F\)</span>.</p>
<p>So what we’ve ended up with is a map <span id="eq:cnpp1oiwza" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpp1oiwza}\tag{5}
  T_{\pi_0} \cdot \Delta_{X_0} \hookrightarrow T_{\pi^\sigma} \cdot
\Delta_X.\]</span> Now we want to analyze surjectivity. In the trace
formula (for cyclic base change, anyway), enormous use is made of the
norm operator, which is defined like the usual norm operator, but
defined on the non-abelian group <span
class="math inline">\(D^\times\)</span> rather than just on the
multiplicative group of some field such as <span
class="math inline">\(F^\times\)</span>. This requires making a choice,
such as <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{N}_\sigma : D \ni y
\mapsto y y^{\sigma} y^{\sigma^2} \dotsb.\]</span> Obviously the norm of
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_0\)</span>. What you find is that <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{N}_\sigma(\gamma_1) \sim
\mathcal{N}_\sigma(\gamma_2) \implies \gamma_1 \sim^\sigma
\gamma_2.\]</span> Here</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> denotes
conjugacy,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sim^\sigma\)</span> denotes <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-conjugacy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can show in this way that there’s actually a converse map to <a
href="#eq:cnpp1oiwza" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1oiwza">\((5)\)</a>. That’s the mechanism
that the proof of cyclic base change will use. Actually, this refines <a
href="#eq:cnpp1oiwza" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1oiwza">\((5)\)</a> to an
isomorphism.</p>
<p>Now in the usual development of cyclic base change, it’s important to
note that the norm map only gives you a norm map on conjugacy classes,
i.e. it’s not well-defined on elements. You can thus compare orbits and,
more generally, orbital integrals, using this. But we’re not going to
get into it, because this method doesn’t work in the non-solvable case
at all.</p>
<p>We get that far, and with what we have, we can now complete the proof
of base change in this case. We have <span
class="math display">\[\mathop{\mathrm{trace}}T_{\pi_0}
|_{\mathcal{F}_0} =
  \lvert T_{\pi_0} \cdot \Delta_{X_0} \rvert
  =
  \lvert T_{\pi^\sigma} \cdot \Delta_X \rvert
  =
  \mathop{\mathrm{trace}}T_{\pi^\sigma} |_{\mathcal{F}}
  = \mathop{\mathrm{trace}}T_\pi
|_{\mathcal{F}^{\mathrm{inv}}}.\]</span> Here</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the second equality comes from the geometric argument that we
just gave,</p></li>
<li><p>the third equality comes from the trace formula for <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>the fourth equality uses that <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> permutes the non-invariant forms,
but is trivial on the invariant ones.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, we’ve only done this for certain <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> (splitting completely into principal
ideals), but now Cebotarev, using the associated Galois representations,
tells us that we get this for all places.</p>
<p>So that’s what we want to model this argument about generalizing the
trace formula on.</p>
<p>The first key problem in doing so is that, as I said, we don’t have
one <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, so we can’t apply this
argument. But also, the cohomological method simply doesn’t work more
generally.</p>
<p>We replace this now, as in class field theory, we find an analytic
argument to replace this cohomological argument. Let me explain that
first, since this is much simpler. Let’s focus on the case of a
non-solvable extension, with no abelian subquotient. We’ll continue to
use <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F_0\)</span> for the two fields, and we write
<span class="math inline">\(d =[F : F_0]\)</span> for their degree. We
again choose primes <span class="math inline">\(\pi_0\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(F_0\)</span> that split completely into principal
primes in <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, and consider the
following sum <span id="eq:cnpp1o4jp4" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpp1o4jp4}\tag{6}
  \sum_{\pi_0} \frac{1}{d}
  \sum_{\pi \mid \pi_0}
  \sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}^{\mathrm{inv}}}
  a_\pi(f) \cdot \operatorname{Norm}(\pi)^{- s}.\]</span> Here, again,
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F} ^{\mathrm{inv}}\)</span> is (a
basis for) the space of forms invariant under the action of the Galois
group.</p>
<div class="remark">
<p><strong>Remark 6</strong>. “Invariant” is in a suitably defined sense
– there is a choice here regarding whether to take things up to twist.
The thing that’s confusing is that invariant cyclic Galois
representations do not descend, but that’s the only obstruction. For
instance, projective representations always descend.</p>
</div>
<p>We’re going to compare that, on the one hand, to <span id="eq:cnpp1pcyts" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpp1pcyts}\tag{7}
  \sum_{\pi_0} \sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}_0}
  a_{\pi_0}(f_0)
  \operatorname{Norm}(\pi_0)^{- s}.\]</span> Here, as before, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_0\)</span> is a basis for eigenforms
on <span class="math inline">\(F_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the above, we further restrict <span
class="math inline">\(\pi_0\)</span> to primes of degree <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> that split completely in <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, a totally real field that contains the
Hilbert class field <span class="math inline">\(H_F\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. The first sum <a href="#eq:cnpp1o4jp4"
data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1o4jp4">\((6)\)</a> would then be the
main part contributing to these <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions for the supposed base changes
to <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> of these forms. That is to
say, if we actually had base changes to <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, then this would be the main part, at
least as far as convergence goes; the rest over <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (if they existed) would have Dirichlet
series that converge at <span class="math inline">\(\Re(s) =
3/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>By potential automorphy, we can choose <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> are simultaneously
automorphic over <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we make a similar construction as in the discussion of cyclic base
change, then the coefficients here in the non-solvable case would be
<span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{d} \sum_{\pi_0} \sum_{\pi \mid
\pi_0} \sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}^{\mathrm{inv}}}
  a_{\pi}(f)\]</span> will be greater than or equal to <span
class="math display">\[\sum_{\pi_0}  \sum_{f_0 \in \mathcal{F}_0 }
  a_{\pi_0}(f),\]</span> so the difference is nonnegative. Now they’re
not cuspidal these two, but we can match up the Eisenstein parts of <a
href="#eq:cnpp1pcyts" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1pcyts">\((7)\)</a> and <a
href="#eq:cnpp1pcyts" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1pcyts">\((7)\)</a> easily. We thus
obtain an <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function that is
cuspidal (i.e., no pole) and has positive coefficients. It’s not
difficult to deduce that for almost all <span
class="math inline">\(\pi_0\)</span>, we get equality.</p>
<p>That side of the argument, also as in class field theory, can be done
relatively simply. The problem is the construction. How do we get this
map between the two? If we go back to the same kind of argument here
(try and construct a <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in the
same way), we can find that the norm of <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_0\)</span>, but what happens is that you
get the identity, of ideals in <span class="math inline">\(L =
F(\gamma_0) = F(\gamma)\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[(\gamma)
= \prod_t \mathfrak{b}_t^{\sigma_t - 1} \cdot \mathfrak{p}.\]</span>
(This uses some class field theory. You have to set it up right. It’s
not trivial, but you can put yourself in this situation. It’s not just
Hasse’s theorem, as in the cyclic case.) We don’t have a <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> that is picking out the invariant
forms. What I want to do now is, instead of what I did before, let’s
view this as one entry of <span id="eq:cnpp1ptgfj" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpp1ptgfj}\tag{8}
  (\prod T_{b_t} \sigma_t) T_\pi t_{0, i}
  = \prod T_{b_t} \cdot t_{0, i},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(b_t = n_{L / F}(\mathfrak{b}_t)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. Replace <span
class="math inline">\(T_\pi\)</span> by <span
class="math inline">\(T_\pi T_\alpha\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(T_\alpha\)</span> projects to the invariant part.
Once you’ve done that, because <span
class="math inline">\(T_\alpha\)</span> projects, the identity <a
href="#eq:cnpp1ptgfj" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1ptgfj">\((8)\)</a> becomes <span id="eq:cnpp1pvo6p" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnpp1pvo6p}\tag{9}
  T_\pi T_\alpha
  \prod_t T_{b_t}   t_{0, i}
  = \prod_t T_{b_t}  t_{0, i}.\]</span> Now what we do is choose our
<span class="math inline">\(T_{b_t}\)</span> so that they’re invertible.
We have to make sure we can do that in the original thing. Then we view
the products over <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in <a
href="#eq:cnpp1pvo6p" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1pvo6p">\((9)\)</a> as new basis
elements. Now we’re getting something that looks more like the trace of
of <span class="math inline">\(T_\pi T_\alpha\)</span>. For this, we
need that <span class="math inline">\(\prod T_{b_t}\)</span> is
invertible in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}[X]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Okay, so that looks nice, but the issue is that in doing <a
href="#eq:cnpp1ptgfj" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1ptgfj">\((8)\)</a>, I only gave you one
coset representative for the Hecke operator, but we need the whole Hecke
operator, not just one entry. This is where it becomes more complicated.
I’m not going to go into it in detail, but the idea is that you make the
<span class="math inline">\(b_t\)</span>’s complicated ideals (products
of many ideals) and you consider different factorizations of <span
class="math inline">\(b_t\)</span> and you get different
representatives, and you have to do it in such a way that you can make
sure you get all the representatives on both sides of <a
href="#eq:cnpp1pvo6p" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnpp1pvo6p">\((9)\)</a>. So you choose your
<span class="math inline">\(b_t\)</span>’s so that there are many prime
factors, then you can always change each prime factor to its complex
conjugate, which gives you a huge number of choices. Making sure this
works is a little like the ergodic method that people have used. I don’t
want to go into the argument because it is rather involved, but for this
argument to work, we need a version of Cebotarev in this context. What
it says is that</p>

<p>Assertion <a href="#enumerate:cnpp1p8trm" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="enumerate:cnpp1p8trm">\((2)\)</a> is not
yet proved. Over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>,
Khayutin has proved this. Robinson, in his thesis, and generalized some
of this to totally real fields. Unfortunately, we actually need
something a bit stronger: for the subgroup of squares <span
class="math inline">\(L_f^{\times 2}\)</span>, and even the subgroup of
fourth powers <span class="math inline">\(L_f^{\times 4}\)</span>.</p>
<p>How does Khayutin do this? This proof depends initially upon a
classification of measures of Einsiedler–Lindenstrauss. Basically, the
idea is quite <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic. Rather than
doing it with level <span class="math inline">\(U_0\)</span>, they allow
the level at two primes to go to <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> (as the discriminant goes to <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>) and get some invariance. If you
assume that the projections are surjective and equidistributed (which we
know from the first method <a href="#enumerate:cnpp1p8snz"
data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="enumerate:cnpp1p8snz">\((1)\)</a>), then
the joinings theorem of Einsiedler–Lindenstrauss says that the support
must be on some joining. Khayutin finds some nice system of
neighborhoods to calculate whether there could be any. Want to know that
the measure comes from the full space rather than some Hecke operator.
Want to know that no Hecke operator captures too much of the image. In
other words, you’re trying to bound the intersection of the Hecke
operator with the image of this CM orbit. Khayutin does this by reducing
it to a counting argument involving counting numbers of points in a
certain Diophantine geometric setup. He manages to bound it using sieve
theory, a relative trace formula, and arguments from Diophantine
geometry. It’s got a strong <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic
sense to it, by taking level structures of this kind. It does seem a bit
reminiscent of the arguments of Cornut–Vatsal proving Mazur’s
conjecture. But the part that needs proving is not in measure theory,
but instead in number theory and Diophantine geometry.</p>

<p><strong>Remark 8</strong>. The reason we used “split at all finite
primes” is that we think this should work for the Artin conjecture in
simpler cases, because Artin representations are potentially automorphic
– go up to somewhere it’s dihedral. You might think I’m using potential
automorphy in this analytic argument, and we are, because it’s simpler,
but you can always make that analytic argument over a solvable extension
of the base field, using Brauer’s theorem. So we think it may be
possible to understand the Artin conjecture from this point of view.</p>

van Hoften (VU Amsterdam), <em>Igusa stacks and exotic Hecke
correspondences</em></h1>
<p>Let’s say something about exotic Hecke correspondences. This phrase
was perhaps coined by Zhu, but it’s a kind of theme in the geometry of
Shimura varieties, which is that mod <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> Shimura varieties for “related groups”
have “related geometry”. Certainly in work of Ribet this already plays a
role – his proof of the <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-conjecture involves passing
because modular curves (such as in the “<span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
switch”). This was taken up by Helm, who considered unitary Shimura
varieties. There’s then the work of Tian–Xiao; in the work of these two
people, it was all a bit of an art. The work of Xiao–Zhu turned it into
more of a science by giving a rigorous formulation of when these sorts
of things should exist, explaining where they should come from.</p>
<p>We would like to start by giving some examples so that we have a
feeling for what these things are. As a kind of bonus, the result that
we’ll state will apply to these examples.</p>
<div id="example:cnpp15n4tc" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 9</strong>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be a real quadratic field, with <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> split. To be precise, maybe we should
fix an ordering <span class="math inline">\(\{\infty_1, \infty_2
\}\)</span> of the real place, and <span class="math inline">\(\{
\mathfrak{p}_1, \mathfrak{p}_2\}\)</span> for the <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic places. Let <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be the mod <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> Hilbert modular surface, choosing the
level in such a way that it has good reduction. This is some nice smooth
surface over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_p\)</span>. We also
need our Shimura curves. For <span class="math inline">\(i = 1,
2\)</span>, consider <span class="math inline">\(B_i := B_{\infty_i
\mathfrak{p}_i}\)</span>. This is the quaternion algebra over <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> ramified precisely at <span
class="math inline">\(\infty_i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p}_i\)</span>. We denote the
corresponding Shimura curve by <span
class="math inline">\(X_{B_i}\)</span>, over <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_p\)</span>.</p>
<p>What we’re being vague about is that these Shimura curves are defined
over <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, the reflex field, and I’m
not telling you what <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic places
I’m taking. Secretly, we’re fixing an isomorphism <span
class="math display">\[(B_i \otimes \mathbb{A}_f^p )^\times \cong
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(\mathbb{A}_f^p),\]</span> and everything is
canonical relative to this choice.</p>
<p>Tian–Xiao tells us that <span class="math display">\[X_{B_i,
\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}} \hookrightarrow
S_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}}\]</span> as a closed <em>Goren–Oort
stratum</em>. (This surface has two Goren–Oort strata.) These curves
moreover sit inside here Hecke equivariantly.</p>

careful because these Shimura varieties are <em>not</em> of PEL type. To
construct these, you have to put yourself in a situation where, by

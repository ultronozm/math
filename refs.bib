We consider a family $\mathcal{F}$ of automorphic representations of $G \times H$ that is varying at a finite place $w$ that splits in $E/F$. We assume that the representations in $\mathcal{F}$ satisfy certain conditions, including being tempered and distinguished by the GGP period. For a representation $\pi \times \pi_H \in \mathcal{F}$ with base change $\Pi \times \Pi_H$ to ${\rm GL}_{n+1}(E) \times {\rm GL}_n(E)$, we prove a subconvex bound \[ L(1/2, \Pi \times \Pi_H^\vee) \ll C(\Pi \times \Pi_H^\vee)^{1/4 - \delta} \] for any $\delta < \tfrac{1}{4n(n+1)(2n^2 + 3n + 3)}$. Our proof uses the unitary Ichino--Ikeda period formula to relate the central $L$-value to an automorphic period, before bounding that period using the amplification method of Iwaniec--Sarnak.},

 We introduce a new technique to count lattice points near curves, which we
use to bound in critical ranges the number of integers in a short interval
divisible by a large square. This uses as an input Green and Tao's quantitative
version of Leibman's theorem on the equidistribution of polynomial orbits in

Sogge's $L^4$-norm bound $\|g\|_4\ll\lambda_g^{1/16}$ for Laplacian
eigenfunctions on a compact Riemann surface by more than a six-fold
power-saving. Via interpolation, this yields $L^p$-norm bounds for Hecke-Maass
cusp forms that are power-saving improvements on Sogge's bounds for all $p>2$.
Our paper marks the first improvement of Sogge's result on the modular surface.
Furthermore, these methods yield for compact arithmetic surfaces the best
$L^4$-norm bound to date.
 Via the Watson-Ichino triple product formula, bounds for the $L^4$-norm of
$g$ are reduced to bounds for certain mixed moments of $L$-functions. We bound
these using two forms of spectral reciprocity. The first is a form of ${\rm
GL}_3\times{\rm GL}_2\leftrightsquigarrow{\rm GL}_4\times{\rm GL}_1$ spectral
reciprocity, which relates a ${\rm GL}_2$ moment of ${\rm GL}_3\times{\rm
GL}_2$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions to a ${\rm GL}_1$ moment of ${\rm
GL}_4\times{\rm GL}_1$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions; this can be seen as a
cuspidal analogue of Motohashi's formula relating the fourth moment of the
Riemann zeta function to the third moment of central values of Hecke
$L$-functions. The second is a form of ${\rm GL}_4\times{\rm
GL}_2\leftrightsquigarrow{\rm GL}_4\times{\rm GL}_2$ spectral reciprocity,
which is a cuspidal analogue of a formula of Kuznetsov for the fourth moment of
central values of Hecke $L$-functions.},

abstract = "In this paper the authors generalize a result of Vogan on irreducibility of standard modules for generic representations from real groups to p-adic ones whenever the inducing data is supercuspidal. They also prove injectivity for standard modules in this case. As applications, the authors prove a number of results relating the poles of intertwining operators and points of reducibility of induced representations to the poles of L-functions defined by the second author, modulo a conjecture on them whose validity for classical groups is also verified here. A result on certain real groups with applications in liftings of automorphic forms from classical groups to general linear groups via L-functions is also proved.
Résumé
Dans cet article les auteurs généralisent un résultat de Vogan sur l'irréductibilité des modules standards pour les représentations génériques des groupes réels vers les groupes p-adiques quand l'induite est supercuspidale. Ils prouvent également l'injectivité pour les modules standards dans ce cas. Les auteurs en déduisent quelques résultats reliant les pôles des opérateurs d'entrelacement et les points d'irréductibilité des représentations induites, aux pôles des fonctions L définies par le deuxième auteur, modulo la validité d'une conjecture que l'on vérifie ici pour les groupes classiques. On montre aussi un résultat sur certains groupes réels avec applications aux correspondances des formes automorphes des groupes classiques vers les groupes linéaires via les fonctions L.",

They also showed that this conjecture is reduced to a certain local identity in the case of unitary groups. In this paper, we study even unitary group case. Indeed, we prove this local identity over $p$-adic fields. Further, we prove an equivalence between this local identity and a refined formal degree conjecture over any local field of characteristic zero. As a consequence, we prove a refined formal degree conjecture over $p$-adic fields and we get an explicit formula of Whittaker Fourier coefficients under certain assumptions.},

We give a characterization, for the orthogonal and symplectic groups, of the generalised Whittaker models possibly contained in this duality theory.

The congruence condition was lifted in 1988 by Duke (building on a break-through by Iwaniec) using completely different techniques. We conjecture that this equidistribution result also extends to the pairs consisting of a vector on the sphere and the shape of the lattice in its orthogonal complement. We use a joining result for higher rank diagonalizable actions to obtain this conjecture under an additional congruence condition.},

Moreover, by using this description, we can prove new cases of the Harris-Viehmann conjecture for non-basic Rapoport-Zink spaces associated to $GL_n$ and prove the non-emptiness property of intersections between affine Schubert cells and semi-infinite cells inside the $B^+_{dR}$-Grassmannian.

This article takes a broad view of ideas beyond the program of endoscopy, highlighting the connections among them, and emphasizing the relationship between local and global aspects. Central among those ideas is the one proposed in a 2000 lecture of R. P. Langlands, aiming to extract from the stable trace formula of a group G the bulk of those automorphic representations in the image of the conjectural functorial lift corresponding to a morphism of L-groups ${^LH} \to {^LG}$. With the extension of the problem of functoriality to the "relative" setting of spherical varieties and related spaces, some structure behind such comparisons has started to reveal itself. In a seemingly unrelated direction, a program initiated by Braverman--Kazhdan, also around 2000, to generalize the Godement--Jacquet proof of the functional equation to arbitrary L-functions, has received renewed attention in recent years. We survey ideas and developments in this direction, as well, and discuss the relationship between the two programs.},

Conditional on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for Hecke $L$-functions over $\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$, we prove that $$\sum_{p \equiv 1 \pmod{3}} \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{p}} \cdot \Big ( \sum_{x \pmod{p}} e^{2\pi i x^3 / p} \Big ) W \Big ( \frac{p}{X} \Big ) \sim \frac{(2\pi)^{2/3}}{3 \Gamma(\tfrac 23)} \int_{0}^{\infty} W(x) x^{-1/6} dx \cdot \frac{X^{5/6}}{\log X},$$ as $X \rightarrow \infty$ and $p$ runs over primes. This explains a well-known numerical bias in the distribution of cubic Gauss sums first observed by Kummer in 1846 and confirms (conditionally on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) a conjecture of Patterson from 1978. There are two important byproducts of our proof. The first is an explicit level aspect Voronoi summation formula for cubic Gauss sums, extending computations of Patterson and Yoshimoto. Secondly, we show that Heath-Brown's cubic large sieve is sharp up to factors of $X^{o(1)}$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. This disproves the popular belief that the cubic large sieve can be improved. An important ingredient in our proof is a dispersion estimate for cubic Gauss sums. It can be interpreted as a cubic large sieve with correction by a non-trivial asymptotic main term. This estimate relies on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, and is one of the fundamental reasons why our result is conditional.},

In this paper, we prove a quantitative equidistribution theorem for polynomial sequences in a nilmanifold, where the average is taken along spheres instead of cubes. To be more precise, let $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ be a sphere. We showed that if a polynomial sequence $(g(n)\Gamma)_{n\in\Omega}$ which is $p$-periodic along $\Omega$ is not equidistributed on a nilmanifold $G/\Gamma$, then there exists a nontrivial horizontal character $\eta$ of $G/\Gamma$ such that $\eta\circ g \mod \mathbb{Z}$ vanishes on $\Omega$. This result will serve as a fundamental tool in later parts of the series to proof the spherical Gowers inverse theorem and the geometric Ramsey conjecture.},

  abstract                 = { We establish a new class of examples of the multivariate Bateman-Horn conjecture by using tools from dynamics. These cases include the determinant polynomial on the space of $n\times n$ matrices, the Pfaffian on the space of skew-symmetric $2n\times 2n$ matrices, and the determinant polynomial on the space of symmetric $n\times n$ matrices. In particular, let $(V,F)$ be any pair among the following: $(\textrm{Mat}_n, \det)$, $(\textrm{Skew}_{2n},\textrm{Pff})$, and $(\textrm{Sym}_n, \det).$ We then obtain an asymptotic for $$\pi_{V,F}(T)= \#\{v\in V: \max(|v_i|)\leq T, F(v) \text{ is prime}\},$$ that matches the Bateman-Horn prediction. The key ingredients of our proof are an asymptotic count for integral points on the level sets of $F$ given by Linnik equidistribution, a geometric approximation of the box by cones, and an upper bound sieve to bound the number of prime values missed by the approximation. In the case of the determinant polynomial on symmetric matrices, we must also use the Siegel mass formula to compute the product of local densities for the main term.},

In the proof of the main theorem, we show that if the global deformation rings are not flat over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ at the minimal level, then after allowing ramification at one auxiliary prime, the new parts of the global rings enjoy the flatness property. The proof is independent of the parity of the representations. Previously, flatness was only known in established cases of Langlands reciprocity in the odd parity, while it is new for even deformation rings in balanced global settings of rank one. As a corollary, we show that by choosing the auxiliary prime appropriately, we can control the rank mod $p$ of the new part of the flat ring. The examples of $3$-adic representations and flat, even deformation rings are built by applying techniques from global class field theory to a family of totally real fields studied by D. Shanks. In the process of constructing the even residual representations, we show that there exist cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ and $\pi'$ of $\operatorname{GL}(2,\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}})$ attached to classical Maass wave forms of level $\ell=20887$ whose mod 3 reductions are distinct. The proof applies a theorem of R. P. Langlands from his theory of base change.},

$PGL_2(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q})$ of arithmetic conductor $C$ and archimedean
parameter $T$, and let $\phi$ be an $L^2$-normalized automorphic form in the
space of $\pi$. The sup-norm problem asks for bounds on $\| \phi \|_\infty$ in
terms of $C$ and $T$. The quantum unique ergodicity (QUE) problem concerns the
limiting behavior of the $L^2$-mass $|\phi|^2 (g) \, d g$ of $\phi$. All
previous work on these problems in the conductor-aspect has focused on the case
that $\phi$ is a newform.
 In this work, we study these problems for a class of automorphic forms that
are not newforms. Precisely, we assume that for each prime divisor $p$ of $C$,
the local component $\pi_p$ is supercuspidal (and satisfies some additional
technical hypotheses), and consider automorphic forms $\phi$ for which the
local components $\phi_p \in \pi_p$ are "minimal" vectors. Such vectors may be
understood as non-archimedean analogues of lowest weight vectors in holomorphic
discrete series representations of $PGL_2(\mathbb{R})$.
 For automorphic forms as above, we prove a sup-norm bound that is sharper
than what is known in the newform case. In particular, if $\pi_\infty$ is a
holomorphic discrete series of lowest weight $k$, we obtain the optimal bound
$C^{1/8 -\epsilon} k^{1/4 - \epsilon} \ll_{\epsilon} |\phi|_\infty
\ll_{\epsilon} C^{1/8 + \epsilon} k^{1/4+\epsilon}$. We prove also that these
forms give analytic test vectors for the QUE period, thereby demonstrating the
equivalence between the strong QUE and the subconvexity problems for this class
of vectors. This finding contrasts the known failure of this equivalence for
newforms of powerful level.},

result shows that the Genestier-Lafforgue parameter of a tempered $\pi$ can be
uniquely refined to a tempered L-parameter $\CL(\pi)$, thus giving the unique
local Langlands correspondence which is compatible with the Genestier-Lafforgue
construction. Our second result establishes ramification properties of
$\CL^{ss}(\pi)$ for unramfied $G$ and supercuspidal $\pi$ constructed by
induction from an open compact (modulo center) subgroup. If $L^{ss}(\pi)$ is
pure in an appropriate sense, we show that $\CL^{ss}(\pi)$ is ramified (unless
$G$ is a torus). If the inducing subgroup is sufficiently small in a precise
sense, we show $\mathcal{L}^{ss}(\pi)$ is wildly ramified. The proofs are via
global arguments, involving the construction of Poincar\'e series with strict
control on ramification when the base curve is $\PP^1$ and a simple application
of Deligne's Weil II.},

We also prove that the number of real zeros (localized away from $1$) of Fekete polynomials associated to a typical fundamental discriminant is $\gg \frac{\log\log D}{\log\log\log\log D}.$ This comes close to establishing a conjecture of Baker and Montgomery which predicts $\asymp \log \log D$ real zeros. These results rely crucially on quantitative estimates for the joint distribution of $-\frac{L'}{L}(s, \chi_D)$ at several points $s$ in the vicinity of the central point $s=1/2$, as well as concentration results for $\log L(s,\chi_D)$ in the same range, which we establish. In the second part of the paper, we obtain, for large families of discriminants, non-trivial upper bounds on the number of real zeros of Fekete polynomials, breaking the square root bound. Finally, we construct families of discriminants with associated Fekete polynomials having no zeros away from $1.$},

As a corollary, we obtain asymptotic formulas for the first three moments with a power-saving error term, and detect the 0- and 1-swap terms in related problems for any $k$ (conditionally under the Generalized Lindel\"of Hypothesis), recovering the recent results of Conrey and Rodgers on long Dirichlet polynomials. The advantage of our method is its simplicity, since we don't need to modify the multiple Dirichlet series to obtain its meromorphic continuation. As a result, we obtain the asymptotic formulas directly in the form as they appear in the recipe predictions of Conrey, Farmer, Keating, Rubinstein and Snaith.},

This space carries actions of the foliated Laplacian derived from the SL(2,R)-action as well as various differential operators related to relative period translations. In the paper we give spectral decompositions for the stratum of tori with two marked points. This is a homogeneous space for a special affine group, which is not reductive and thus does not fall into well-studied cases of the Langlands program, but still allows to employ techniques from representation theory and global analysis. Even for this simple stratum exhibiting all Siegel-Veech transforms requires novel configurations of saddle connections. We also show that the contiunuous spectrum of the foliated Laplacian is much larger than the space of Siegel-Veech transforms, as opposed to the case of the modular curve. This defect can be remedied by using instead a compound Laplacian involving relative period translations.},

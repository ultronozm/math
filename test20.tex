\begin{abstract}
We record some exercises whose purpose is to verify that certain classes of vectors in representations of $\SO(3)$ and $\PGL_2(\mathbb{R})$ are ``localized'' in a strong sense under the action of those groups.

\section{Overview}\label{sec:d1a9162ede03}

The purpose of this note is to record some exercises that aim to convey some computational feeling for ``localized vectors'' in the precise sense defined in \S\ref{sec:d1a8de614cc9}

Pohl, <em>Period functions for vector-valued Maass cusp forms and Jacobi
Maass cusp forms</em></h1>
<p>(joint work with Roelof Bruggeman and YoungJu Choie)</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Gamma :=
{\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>.</p>
<p>We consider classical Maass cusp forms <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>. We write <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> for the spectral parameter, so that the
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>-eigenvalue is <span
class="math inline">\(s(1 - s)\)</span>.</p>
<p>These enjoy a bijective correspondence with certain <em>period
functions</em> <span class="math display">\[f :(0, \infty) \rightarrow
\mathbb{C},\]</span> which are analytic functions satisfying <span
class="math display">\[f(t) = f(t + 1) +(t + 1)^{- 2 s} f \left(
\frac{t}{t + 1} \right)\]</span> such that the function <span
class="math display">\[t \mapsto
  \begin{cases}
    f(t)    &amp; \text{ on }(0, \infty), \\
    - \frac{1}{\lvert t \rvert^{2 s}} f\left(-
\frac{1}{t}\right)            &amp; \text{ on }(- \infty, 0)
  \end{cases}\]</span> extends continuously to <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> (and <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>).</p>
<p>This was introduced by Lewis–Zagier and generalized/extended to other
Fuchsian groups by Bruggemann, Lewis, Zagier, Pohl, ...</p>
<p>We wanted to generalize to higehr rank groups, but keeping the
situation near to what we see here. We consider the case of Jacobi Maass
forms. Let’s give a half-definition of those. Set <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma^J := \mathrm{Hei}(\mathbb{Z}) \rtimes
\Gamma\)</span>, which acts naturally on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{H} \times \mathbb{C}\)</span>. A Jacobi
Maass form (JMF) of weight <span class="math inline">\(k \in
\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and index <span class="math inline">\(m \in
\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\)</span> is roughly a function <span
class="math display">\[F : \mathbb{H} \times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow
\mathbb{C}\]</span> satisfying the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>equivariance: for all <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \in
\Gamma^J\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[F \mid_{k, m}^J
g = F.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>eigenfunction of differential operators</p></li>
<li><p>decay</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Pitale gave a theta decomposition: for <span
class="math inline">\((\tau, z) \in \mathbb{H} \times
\mathbb{C}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[F(\tau, z) = \sum_{j
\pmod{2 m}} F_j(\tau) \Theta_{m, j}(\tau, z),\]</span> for certain theta
functions <span class="math display">\[\Theta_{m, j}(\tau, z) = \left(
\Im \tau \right)^{1/4} \sum_{r \equiv j \pmod{2 m}}
  e^{\pi i \tau r^2 / 2 m} e^{2 \pi i r z}.\]</span> Here <span
class="math inline">\((F_j)_{j \pmod{2 m}}\)</span> is a vector-valued
Maass form of weight <span class="math inline">\(k - 1/2\)</span>. Note
that this weight is a half-integer. We eventually realized that this was
not an issue – one could indeed work with general real weights, we just
needed to extend the theta decomposition accordingly. In particular, we
can relax <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to be a real
number.</p>
<p>Let’s now give more precise definitions of the objects of interest.
We consider vector-valued Maass cusp forms of weight <span
class="math inline">\(k \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> and a unitary
representation <span class="math inline">\(\rho : \Gamma \rightarrow
\mathop{\mathrm{U}}(n)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n \in
\mathbb{N}\)</span>. These are smooth functions <span
class="math inline">\(u : \mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n\)</span>
that satisfy</p>
<ol>
<li><p>equivariance with respect to a multiplier system <span
class="math display">\[v_k : \Gamma \rightarrow
\mathbb{C}^\times,\]</span> <span class="math display">\[v_k(g) =
\frac{\eta(g z)^{2 k}}{(c z + d)^k \eta(z)^{2 k}}, \qquad
    g =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      a      &amp; b \\
      c &amp; d \\
    \end{pmatrix} \in \Gamma,\]</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(z \in \mathbb{H}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> is the Dedekind eta.</p></li>
<li><p>eigenfunction of <span class="math display">\[\Delta_k = -
y^2(\partial_{x}^2 + \partial_y^2) + i k y \partial_x,
    \quad
    z = x + i y,\]</span> thus <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_k u =
s(1 - s) u\)</span>. (Here we’ve changed the role of <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.)</p></li>
<li><p>exponential decay at <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We now define Jacobi Maass cusp forms (JMCF)? Let <span
class="math inline">\(k \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> be the weight, <span
class="math inline">\(m \in \mathbb{N}_{0}\)</span> be the index/level.
We don’t need to use the same multiplier system as above; the other ones
are all obtained by a slight modification indexed by a parameter <span
class="math inline">\(a \in \mathbb{Z} / 12 \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. The
multiplier is defined using a function <span
class="math display">\[\varphi_a : \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times
, \quad \varphi_a \left(
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1      &amp; 1 \\
      0 &amp; 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix} \right) = e^{- \pi i a / 6},
  \quad
  \varphi_a \left(
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0      &amp; -1 \\
      1 &amp; 0 \\
    \end{pmatrix} \right)
  = e^{- \pi i a / 2},\]</span> and we then want to require <span
class="math display">\[F \mid_{\varphi_a v_k, k, m}^J g :=
\varphi_a(g)^{-1} v_k(g)^{-1} F \mid_{k, m}^J g, \quad g \in J.\]</span>
For shorthand, we write <span class="math display">\[F \mid_{\varphi_a
v_k, k, m}^J h =: F \mid_{k, m}^J h, \quad h \in
\mathrm{Hei}(\mathbb{Z}).\]</span> Then we require that for all <span
class="math inline">\(g \in \Gamma^J\)</span>, we have the equivariance
property <span class="math inline">\(F \mid_{\varphi_a v_k, k, m}^J g =
F\)</span>. We also require the Casimir eigenfunction property <span
class="math inline">\(C^{k, m} F = \lambda(s, k) F\)</span>.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong> (BCP). <em>The space of Jacobi–Maass cusp
forms with weight <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, index <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, spectral parameter <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, and multiplier system <span
class="math inline">\(\varphi_a v_k\)</span> is isomorphic to the space
of Maass cusp forms for <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> with
weight <span class="math inline">\(k - \tfrac{1}{2}\)</span>, parameter
<span class="math inline">\(\tfrac{s + 1}{2}\)</span>, and multiplier
<span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{a, m v_k - \tfrac{1}{2}}\)</span>.
The bijection is given by a theta decomposition.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Our goal is now to give a period function notion of the right hand
side of this bijection (the one involving Maass forms).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Given a Maass cusp form <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>

<div class="remark">
<p><strong>Remark 2</strong>. Why this path of integration? It’s
motivated by trying to discretize the geodesic flow, in a classical way.
For this, you need a cross-section on the tangent bundle that is so
discrete that it catches geodesics well. We write down an operator <span

intersection with our geodesic. [Editor note: There are pictures, but
I’m not so good at transcribing pictures, I guess. Sorry. Maybe next

the form <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>? The old form was
<span class="math inline">\(\eta_s(u, t) =[u, R_s(t, \bullet)]\)</span>.
Now some precise formulas. The kernel that we need to have is <span

\right) \, d \bar{z},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\Delta_k = -
y^2(\partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2) + i k y \partial_x.\]</span> Now if we

the function <span class="math display">\[\Delta_{- k} R_{s, k}(t,

Gille, <em>Loop torsors, Galois cohomology and more</em></h1>
<p>We decided to give kind of a survey talk, starting from torsors in
some cohomological way, and coming to fresh things only at the end.</p>
<p>Let’s start with basic things. We’ll simplify our life by taking a
field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of characteristic zero. We
take for <span class="math inline">\(k_s\)</span> a separable closure,
and write <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_k =
\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(k_s / k)\)</span>. Given a Galois module <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we may define the continuous group
cohomology <span class="math display">\[H^i(k, A) :=
H^i_{\mathrm{cts}}(\Gamma_k, A).\]</span> Serre (1962) decided to extend
such definitions to a non-abelian settingn. Given a linear algebraic
group <span class="math inline">\(G _{/k} \subseteq
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_n\)</span>, we define <span
class="math display">\[H^0(k, G) := {\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_n(k),\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[H^1(k, G) :=
  \begin{cases}
    \text{$1$-cocycles}    &amp;  \\
    \text{torsors}.                           &amp;

</div>
<p>To give the flavor, for <span

<span class="math inline">\(S = \left( (\mu_n)^n / \mu_n \right) \rtimes

<p>We now switch to <em>rings</em>. Let <span

classes of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-torsors <span

<span class="math display">\[X \times_R G \cong X \times_R X\]</span>
over <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow \mathop{\mathrm{Spec}}(R)\)</span>
is surjective. We have analogues of Theorem <a
href="#theorem:cnra0ah0ad" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="theorem:cnra0ah0ad">2.8</a> when <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a local ring. My colleagues and I
were interested in more general rings, in particular, polynomial rings
and rings of Laurent polynomials. It’s very interesting to look at the
reduction of torsors to find the smallest subgroup. For example, maybe
you know the famous result of Quillen–Suslin (1976), which says that if
you take the ring <span class="math inline">\(R = k[X_1, \dotsc,
X_d]\)</span>, then all finitely-generated projective modules are free.
Equivalently, because <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_n\)</span> is the group of
automorphisms of the free projective module of rank <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, this result says that <span
class="math display">\[H^1(R, \mathrm{GL}_n) = \{1\}.\]</span> If you
know that we have a surjection <span class="math display">\[H^1(R, S)
\twoheadrightarrow
  H^1(R, \mathrm{GL}_n)\]</span> for some finite <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, then it ends the proof. This is
because the LHS is then nothing but <span class="math inline">\(H^1(k,
S)\)</span>, which goes to <span class="math inline">\(H^1(k,
{\mathop{\mathrm{PGL}}}_n)\)</span>. So if someone were able to show that
for this kind of ring that we have this kind of reduction, then it would
give an alternate proof of this famous result of Quillen–Suslin. (We
don’t know how to do that.)</p>
<p>Consider now the Laurent polynomial ring <span
class="math display">\[R_n = k[X^{\pm 1}, \dotsc, X^{\pm n}],\]</span>
or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}[e^{i \theta_1}, \dotsc, e^{i
\theta_n}]\)</span>. Given a ring <span class="math inline">\(R
/k\)</span>, we define loop torsors for <span
class="math inline">\(G_{/k}\)</span>. This class includes “finite
torsors”. Take a ring <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and a
Galois cover <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with Galois group
<span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>. In this Galois cover, you
have a part <span class="math inline">\(R_{\ell}\)</span> given by
extension of constants, thus <span class="math inline">\(\ell /
k\)</span> is a Galois extension of fields, with <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(\ell / k)\)</span> acting on
the extension <span class="math inline">\(R_{\ell} / R\)</span>. Then
<span class="math display">\[H^1(\Gamma, G(S)) \hookrightarrow H^1(R,
G),\]</span> with a map <span class="math inline">\(H^1(\Gamma, G(\ell))
\rightarrow H^1(\Gamma, G(S))\)</span>. We call a class a <em>loop</em>
if it satisfies this.</p>

<p>This theorem has a big drawback, which is the following. <span

</div>
<p>The above story was all ten years ago. Three years ago, Parimala from
Emory called the speaker and said that she liked this framework of loop
things, but it’s too bad because you work with rings over a field. We do
arithmetics, and are interested in rings like <span
class="math display">\[R := \mathbb{Z}_p[[t]][1/t, 1/p].\]</span> She
said that there should also be loop torsors, etc., for these kinds of
rings. This turned out to be true, after some work.</p>
<p>If we want to abstract such rings, we take <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to be a regular henselian ring with
parameters <span class="math inline">\(f_1, \dotsc, f_r\)</span>. Take
<span class="math inline">\(D = \operatorname{div}(f_1) + \dotsb +
\operatorname{div}(f_r)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_D =
A_{f_1 \dotsb f_r}\)</span>. What is nice is that there is a theory of
covers (Abyankar’s covers), and with those covers, you can play exactly
the same game as with what we erased. Namely, take your ring <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, take <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (finite <span>é</span>tale Galois).</p>

<p>We define the notions of matrix coefficients and cuspidal,
square-integrable and tempered representations.</p>
<p>Langlands classification. Let <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt;
\alpha_2 \leq \alpha_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha
&gt; 0\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\chi_1, \chi_2, \chi,
\chi &#39;\)</span> be unitary characters of <span
class="math inline">\(E^\times\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\chi &#39; \notin X_{1_{F^\times}}\)</span>. Let
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> be a tempered representation
of <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2(E)\)</span>. Let
<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> be a tempered representation
of <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{U}}(3)\)</span>. Etc.
Form the Langlands quotient. Restrict to <span
class="math inline">\(\chi_1, \chi_2 \in X_{N_{E/F},
E^\times}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="lemma">
<p><strong>Lemma 18</strong>. Assume that we have a continuous family of
induced irreducible representatiosn on the same vector space, indexed by
a connected set, that possess nontrivial hermitian <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-invariant forms. Suppose that some
representation in the family is unitary. If a family of non-degenerate
hermitian forms on a finite dimensional space is positive definite at
one point of the index set, then it is positive definite everywhere.
Hence each representation in the family is unitary.</p>
</div>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be reductive over a <span

<p>Theorem: we can describe more generally when such representations are
unitary.</p>
<p>The irreducible and unitary dual of the unitary group has a role in
the Langlands program, which establishes a (conjectural) correspondence
between representations of reductive algebraic groups and
representations of Weil–Deligne groups. For classical groups, being
linear groups, we can obtain information about the non-linear Galois
groups <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(\bar{F}/F)\)</span>, their
subgroups and representations.</p>
<p>For <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)\)</span>:
Henniart (2000), Harris–Taylor (2001), Scholze (2010). Characterized by
preserving <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-factors and <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-factors of pairs, and
compatible with twisting and duals.</p>
<p>The points of reducibility are given by the zeros and poles of
intertwining operators, coinciding with the zeros and poles of the
Plancherel measure that can also be expressed in terms of fractions of
certain <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions (Sha90, Sil79).
A tool for <em>unitarity</em> is to integrate the theory of affine hecke
algebras. Properties of the representations of Hecke algebras (like
unitarity) can often be transferred to the representations of reductive
algebraic groups.</p>
<p>For each non-archimedean place <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, we obtain a reductive algebraic group
<span class="math inline">\(G_p\)</span> and a representation <span
class="math inline">\(\pi_p\)</span>. Glueing these together with those
coming from the archimedean places gives a representation of the adelic
group <span class="math inline">\(G_{\mathbb{A}}\)</span>, giving a path
to formulate the global Langlands program.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G_{/\mathbb{Q}}\)</span> be a
reductive algebraic group, e.g., <span class="math inline">\(G =
\mathrm{GL}_n\)</span>. Automorphic cusp forms. <span
class="math inline">\(L_0^2(G(\mathbb{Q}) \backslash G(A))\)</span>
decomposes as <span class="math inline">\(\oplus m(\pi) H_\pi\)</span>.
The local representations <span class="math inline">\(\pi_v\)</span>
have to satisfy some constraints: for almost all <span

and must be unitary. Examples coming from classical modular forms.</p>

id="radu-toma-effective-equidistribution-in-analysing-algorithmic-hardness">Radu
Toma, <em>Effective equidistribution in analysing algorithmic
hardness</em></h1>
<p>Today we’ll discuss application of spectral theory of automorphic
forms to analyzing how hard some problems are in cryptography.</p>
<p>You have two parties, two friends let’s say, say Radu and Edgar, and
they want to communicate over the internet – maybe some gossip about
their boss? They decide that the internet is an unsafe channel, which
means that they each generate a public key PK and a secret key SK. Using
these, they can encrypt the message, where it looks like gibberish as it
goes through the channel (so that nobody looking at that can understand
it). But maybe the boss, say Valentin, wants to understand what the
gossip is all about. What the boss sees is just the public keys and the
gibberish message. The protocol makes it hard to do this – it requires
the adversary to solve a hard problem. But you say, watch out, the boss
is really good at solving hard problems! That might be true, but even a
<em>super</em>computer would have a hard time decoding these. In
particular, solving such problems takes longer than polynomial time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Diffie–Helmann (<span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>): discrete
logarithm problem (e.g., in modular arithmetic or on elliptic curve),
i.e., given <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b = a^i\)</span>, find <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>RSA: facatorization of large numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Knapsack problem and others did not give rise to safe
protocols.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The issue is that before it was all about breaking the protocols
using normal computers you have at the moment, but you might have heard
that there is a potential future in which we might have actual
functional quantum computers. There is a famous algorithm of Shor that
shows that the discrete logarithm problem, and factorization, are
actually easy for a quantum computer. So a quantum computer can actually
break much existing encryption. So people look for problems that are
quantum-hard, so that we could use it for cryptography in the future.
Some examples of the latter are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>isogenies: given two supersingular elliptic curves with the same
number of points, compute an isogeny between them</p></li>
<li><p>shortest vector problem (SVP): given a lattice, compute (length
of) shortest vector.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There was some drama a couple years ago when a generalization of
Diffie–Helmann got spectacularly broken (“by a single-core PC in one
hour”). We’ll talk more about lattice-based cryptography, but let’s
focus on the problem that we’re interested in at the moment. The issue
is that in these protocols, you have to generate keys, generated
according to some distribution that you decide. It could be a random
distribution, but that’s not entirely clear (how do you generate large
prime numbers?). Expectations on hardness are in the <em>worst
case</em>: for any algorithm that tries to solve the problem, <em>there
is an instance</em> on which it fails. For better security assumptions,
want <em>worst-case to average-case reductions</em>: a way to relate the
average case to the worst case.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the problem of computing isogenies. Look at
all supersingular elliptic curves over <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_{p^2}\)</span> for some given <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Think of this as a graph, where the
elliptic curves are vertices and edges represent isogenies of some given
low degree (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>). The worst
case: take any two elliptic curves and try to compute an isogeny between
them. Your assumption might be: perhaps there is an algorithm that does
this efficiently for two <em>random</em> pairs of elliptic curves. What
we’d like to show is that we can then also efficiently solve the worst
case (contrary to what we know or expect regarding hardness). Solution:
start random walk from both elliptic curves, compute isogeny, walk back.
The graph is Ramanujan: the walk equidistributes fast.</p>
<p>How eays are lattice problems, e.g., SVP, on average? More subtle:
usually work with approximate versions, e.g., <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-SVP: given a lattice <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, find vectors of length at most <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma \cdot \lambda_1(L)\)</span> (“approximately
the shortest vector”). You might say, well, I know an algorithm that
computes this, there’s this famous algorithm LLL that solves <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-SVP in poly-time for <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma = \operatorname{O}(2^n)\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(n = \operatorname{rk}(L)\)</span>. The only
issue is that the approximation factor is exponential in the rank <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. As soon as <span
class="math inline">\(n &gt; 4\)</span>, LLL reaches its limits.</p>
<p>Fix a number field <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> of degree
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p>Module lattice: <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_K\)</span>-module <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> of rank <span

{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r(\hat{\mathcal{O}}_K)\)</span>. There are special
lattices of rank <span class="math inline">\(d r\)</span> (e.g., points
on closed geodesics in the modular curve, or CM points).</p>
<p>Cryptographers (De Boer, Ducas, Pellet–Mary, Wesolowski, CRYPTO
2020): Assume <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>-th cyclotomic field, <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> a prime power. If there is a polynomial
algorithm for solving <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-Hermite-SVP over random module
lattices of rank <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (called
<em>ideal lattices</em>), then there is a poly-time algorithm for
solving <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &#39;\)</span>-Hermite SVP
for any ideal lattice, with <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &#39; =
\gamma \cdot \operatorname{O}(m^{1/2 + \varepsilon})\)</span>. (This
extends to other number fields, with more involved factors.)</p>
<p>De Boer, Page, Toma, Wesolowski (soon): similar for SIVP for (fixed)
rank <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> – polynomial approximation
factors in terms of the degree of <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.</p>
<p>Idea:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start from an arbitrary module lattice <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Deform a little at the archimedean places (the
geometry).</p></li>
<li><p>Take sublattices of index <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>,
i.e., apply a Hecke operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrive at a random distribution thanks to the spectral gap of
Hecke operators (e.g., as in Clozel–Ullmo).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Mathematically, <span class="math inline">\(g \in
{\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_r(K_{\mathbb{R}})\)</span> parametrizes your
lattice <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Look at <span
class="math display">\[f_g(h) = \sum_{\gamma} f(g^{-1} \gamma
h),\]</span> a bump function around <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Equidistribution: <span
class="math display">\[\lVert T_{\mathfrak{p}} f_g - \langle f_g, 1
\rangle \rVert \ll p^{-1/2} \lVert f_g \rVert.\]</span> Need good
control over the size of <span class="math inline">\(\lVert f_g
\rVert\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>; thus also need new tools in the
cusp, where it is big. Dream is to good this for generic lattices: <span
class="math display">\[\lVert T_{\mathfrak{p}} f_g - \langle f_g, 1
\rangle \rVert \ll p^{-(r-1)/2} \lVert f_g \rVert.\]</span> Again, hard

</ul>
<p>The reductive case (when <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is
general) has been studied by Nisnevich (1982-84) and then clarified by
Guo (2020). The original idea of Nisnevich was to use patching
techniques (we’ll explain it later) to show that the problem reduces to
two subproblems:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>: local complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Proving that the decomposition <span
class="math inline">\(G(\hat{K}) =
\mathcal{G}(\hat{R})\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first point has already been proved by Bruhat–Tits. Nisnevich
uses their result, but at that time, their paper wasn’t released, and
the literature seems to have forgotten that it was in their paper.
Nisnevich also hasn’t precised how the semisimple case gives the
reductive case.</p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll present a general setup to study the main
problem. In particular, we’ll deduce from it a simplified proof of
Grothendieck–Serre (when <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is
semilocal) and the following result.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about patching techniques. We want to reduce the problem
to two subproblems. Consider the commutative diagram <span
class="math display">\[\begin{CD}         
    H^1_{\mathop{\mathrm{et}}}(R, G)    @&gt;&gt;&gt;
H^1_{\mathop{\mathrm{et}}}(\hat{R}, G)\\
    @VVV  @VVV \\
    H^1_{\mathop{\mathrm{et}}}(K, G)    @&gt;&gt;&gt;

<div class="theorem">

injectivity? A rapid calculation shows that the fiber of an element
<span class="math inline">\(g \in G(\hat{K})\)</span> is given exactly
by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}(\hat{R}) g G(K)\)</span>,
etc.</p>
<p>How to study the decomposition problem? How do we study the
obstruction of getting <span class="math inline">\(G(\hat{K}) = G(K)
\mathcal{G}(\hat{R})\)</span>? First, observe that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}(\hat{R})\)</span> is an open subgroup
of <span class="math inline">\(G(\hat{K})\)</span>. Usual topology
results then show that <span class="math inline">\(G(K)
\mathcal{G}(\hat{R}) = \overline{G(K)} \mathcal{G}(\hat{R})\)</span>. We
now need to understand how big <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{G(K)}\)</span> is in <span
class="math inline">\(G(\hat{K})\)</span>. A good group to study in
general is <span class="math inline">\(G(\hat{K})^+\)</span>, the
(normal) subgroup of <span class="math inline">\(G(\hat{K})\)</span>
generated by all the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{K}\)</span>-points
of relative root groups. When <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is
isotropic over <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, it verifies <span
class="math inline">\(G(\hat{K})^+ \subset \overline{G(K)^+}\)</span>.
Three cases are possible:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is anisotropic over <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{K}\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\(G(\hat{K})^+ = 0 \subset
\overline{G(K)}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is isotropic over <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\(G(\hat{K})^+ \subset \overline{G(K)^+} \subset
\overline{G(K)}\)</span>:</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is anisotropic over <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> but isotropic over <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{K}\)</span>: ???.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is a trick to deal with the last case:</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 25</strong> (Prasad, 1982). <em>Let <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> be a <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{K}\)</span>-almost simple group. Then every
open unbounded subgroup over <span
class="math inline">\(H(\hat{K})\)</span> contains <span
class="math inline">\(H(\hat{K})^+\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>This powerful theorem has been surprisingly forgotten in the
literatuer.</p>
<p>To simplify, let us show that we can apply it to <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{G(K)}\)</span> when <span
class="math inline">\(G_{\hat{K}}\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{K}\)</span>-almost simple (the general case
works but is more technical). Since <span
class="math inline">\(G_{\hat{K}}\)</span> is isotropic, it admits a
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{K}\)</span>-isotropic maximal torus.
Using this, we can eventually deduce that <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{G(K)}\)</span> is unbounded. As for
proving that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{G(K)}\)</span> is
open, there are multiple ways. It suffices to show it contains an open.
Guo actually proves that. A classical trick of Raghunathan also gives
the inclusion. Thus we have finally proven the inclusion <span
class="math inline">\(G(\hat{K})^+ \subset \overline{G(K)}\)</span>.
Let’s recall what we have done for the unboundedness. We took an
isotropic maximal torus. The trick used for proving unboundedness can be
used to show that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{G(K)}\)</span>
also contains <span class="math inline">\(S(\hat{K})\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a maximal <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{K}\)</span>-split torus. We finally obtain
what is required.</p>
<p>We can then conclude the following cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> semisimple
simply-connected.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> reductive.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can actually create groups where the decomposition does not
hold.</p>
<p>To finish, let’s discuss the complete case. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{K}^{\mathrm{ur}} / K\)</span> denote the
maximal unramified extension of the group <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma^{\mathrm{ur}}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{R}^{\mathrm{ur}}\)</span> its DVR.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> is a
stabilizer of a facet (case <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> of

<p>The analogue of Stephanous theorem is open. We want to ask whether CM

\mathbb{Q}(q_1, q_2, q_3, j_1(q), j_2(q), j_3(q)) \geq 3\]</span> to
hold “generically”. Our answer to this question is that it depends –
“yes” in degrees <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, they are not exceptions for being CM.
The reason is that they belong to a special subvariety consisting of
infinitely many points.</p>

<h2 id="origami-and-teichmüller-curves">Origami and Teichmüller
curves</h2>
<p>We fold some origami. But it’s kinda hard for me to tex up origami,
so I guess we’re in trouble here. Anyway, we can fold some origami and
then count the numbers of faces, edges and vertices to compute the Euler
characteristic of the resulting folded surface. In the specific example
depicted on the blackboard, we get a surface of genus <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, with some marked points.</p>
<p>These are the type of objects we want to study: we take some
Euclidean squares and glue them by translation. I prefer another way to
define them, namely, if you start with something like this, you have a
natural map to the torus (namely, one square with opposite edges glued),
so the surface comes with a natural covering of the torus: <span
class="math display">\[p : X \rightarrow T.\]</span> The covering is an
almost unramified covering, with all ramification over the one point at
the vertex that we’ll call <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>.
This is what we call “origami” or a “square-tiled” surface. This
covering comes with an additional “translation structure”:</p>
<div class="remark">
<p><strong>Remark 33</strong>. The open subset <span
class="math inline">\(X^\ast := X - p^{-1}(\infty)\)</span> carries a
natural atlas <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, where the charts
come from the embedding of the squares into the plane, which is actually
a <em>translation atlas</em>, i.e., the transition maps are all
(locally) translations, i.e., given by additional by some vector in
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>This is the geometric object that we obtain. Since basically we can
push up the structure that we have on the Euclidean plane, this gives us
a metric on the surface, as well as a notion of directions on our
surface. We also get the structure of a Riemann surface. We can extend
it to the missing points, giving a holomorphic structure on all of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. That is, <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> defines a holomorphic structure <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Then <span class="math display">\[\in
\mathcal{M}_g := \text{moduli space of closed Riemann surfaces of genus
$g$}.\]</span> We obtain a holomorphic differential on <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, which is the pullback of <span
class="math inline">\(d z\)</span>.</p>
<p>We in fact get a whole family of translation structures, given by a
curve in the moduli space. For <span class="math inline">\(A \in
{\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{R})\)</span>, we define the translation
atlas <span class="math inline">\(\mu_A\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(X^\ast\)</span> by composing each chart with the
linear map <span class="math display">\[\begin{pmatrix}
    x    \\
    y
  \end{pmatrix}
  \mapsto A
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x    \\
    y
  \end{pmatrix}.\]</span> We can again extend this to obtain <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}_A\)</span>, hence a holomorphic
structure, hence a point in the moduli space. This gives a map <span
class="math display">\[{\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow

\hat{\mu}_A)].\]</span></p>

</ol>
</div>
<p>What often happens is that these <span
class="math inline">\(a(n)\)</span> count something. Some basic
examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(r_4(n) = \# \left\{(a, b, c, d) \in
\mathbb{Z}^4 : a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = n \right\}\)</span>. You might
ask: is there a nicer formula for <span
class="math inline">\(r_4(n)\)</span> that just what you get by
counting, or can you describe its asymptotic growth? One way to approach
these question is to consider the generating series. Turns out that
<span class="math inline">\(1 + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty r_4(n) q^n\)</span>
is a modular form of weight <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> for
<span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_0(4)\)</span>. One obtains eventually
<span class="math inline">\(r_4(n) = 8 \sum_{ \substack{
      d \mid n  \\
      4 \nmid d      
    } }d\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Quite a different flavor is the partition function <span
class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span>, the number of ways to write <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as a sum of integers <span
class="math inline">\(\leq n\)</span>. We would again like to know
something about the growth (more rigorous than “it’s hard to work out
<span class="math inline">\(p(7)\)</span> by hand”), or a formula. Turns
out that <span id="eq:cnrbgrf226" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnrbgrf226}\tag{8.1}
    \frac{1}{\eta(z)} = q^{- 1/24} \left( 1 + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty p(n)

the <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> function, which turns out
to have a nice product formula <span class="math inline">\(\eta(z) =
q^{1/24} \prod_{n \geq 1}(1 - q^n)\)</span>. The reciprocal <a

data-reference="eq:cnrbgrf226">\((8.1)\)</a> itself is in fact a
<em>weakly</em> holomorphic modular form of weight <span
class="math inline">\(- 1/2\)</span>, where “weakly” means that we allow
poles at the cusp. This enjoys an asymptotic formula (Hardy–Ramanujan,
Rademacher). Bruinier–Ono used the modularity to get a <em>finite</em>
algebraic formula for <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> (i.e.,
writing it as a finite sum of algebraic numbers).</p></li>
<li><p>Yesterday we saw in Claudia’s talk a different example. More
examples relate to the modularity theorem and to monstrous
moonshine.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cm-points-geodesics-and-generating-series">CM points, geodesics,
and generating series</h2>
<p>Next, we want to look at modular forms (or modular “objects”, perhaps
not so nicely behaved as these ones) coming from traces of CM values or
geodesic cycle integrals of other modular objects.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(Q(x, y) = a x^2 + b x y + c
y^2\)</span> be a binary quadratic form with coefficients <span
class="math inline">\(a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. We denote by
<span class="math inline">\(D = b^2 - 4 a c\)</span> the discriminant of
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, which is <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv 0, 1 \pmod{4}\)</span>. We write <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Q}_D\)</span> for the set of all <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>’s with discriminant <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span> acts
on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Q}_D\)</span> with finitely many
orbits.</p>
<p>These binary quadratic forms give rise to CM points if you look at
negative discriminants: for <span class="math inline">\(D &lt;
0\)</span>, the equation <span class="math inline">\(Q(z, 1) = a z^2 + b
z + c = 0\)</span> has a unique solution <span
class="math inline">\(z_Q\)</span> in the upper half-plane <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>. We call this a CM point.</p>
<p>If we instead look at what happens with positive discriminants <span
class="math inline">\(D &gt; 0\)</span>, we get geodesics in the upper
half-plane: <span class="math display">\[c_Q = \left\{ z \in \mathbb{H}
: a \lvert z \rvert^2 + b \Re(z) + c = 0 \right\}.\]</span></p>
<p>Shintani (’73, ’75): for <span class="math inline">\(F \in S_{2 k +
2}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[\sum_{D &gt; 0} \left(
\sum_{Q \in \mathcal{Q}_D / \Gamma}
    \int_{\Gamma_Q \backslash c_Q}
    F(z) Q(z, 1)^k \, d z
  \right) q^D\]</span> is a cusp form of weight <span
class="math inline">\(3/2 + k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Zagier (2002): we have <span class="math inline">\(q^{-1} + \sum_{D
&lt; 0} \left( \sum_{Q \in \mathcal{Q}_D /
{\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z})} \frac{(j + 744)(z_Q)}{\lvert
\Gamma_Q \rvert} \right) q^{- D} \in M_{3/2}^{!}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We want to explain now how the theta correspondence gives a common
framework to prove such results (nowadays we know a lot more in this
direction). The representation-theoretic reason for these things is the
Howe correspondence, where you take a pair of commuting dual reductive
groups, and look at representations that correspond to one another. In
the setting of Shintani’s result, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>
is a modular form for <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{O}(1,
2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a modular form
for <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{R})\)</span>. The
subtlety is that in Shintani’s setting, these are cusp forms, whereas in
Zagier’s, they are weakly modular, hence may blow up at the cusps. In
any event the, framework is to integrate your input <span
class="math inline">\(F(z)\)</span>, which transforms like a modular
form of weight <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, against a theta
kernel <span class="math inline">\(\theta(\tau, z)\)</span>, which has
weight <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> and weight <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\int_{\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}} F(z)
\overline{\theta(\tau, z)} \Im(z)^k \, d \mu(z).\]</span> Borcherds
addressed the convergence issues in the weakly holomorphic case: he
found a way to regularize it, inspired by the work of Javier and Moore.
Borcherds found a way to regularize the integral whenever it diverges.
(The behavior of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> is “too bad”.) If the integral
exists, we obtain a linear map from “functions of weight <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>” to “functions of weight <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>”.</p>
<p>What remains in the case that Shintani looked at are two things:
checking cuspidality of the lift, and you have to really compute that
the Fourier expansion is what you expected it to be. That’s a nice
feature, that it’s usually doable to compute the Fourier expansions of
these things.</p>
<p>In the other case of Zagier’s result, Bruinier and Funke (2006)
realized it as a special case of a theta lifting. They enlarged the
input space significantly to include harmonic weak Maass forms.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 45</strong>. A function <span
class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}\)</span> is
called a <em>harmonic weak Maass form</em> of weight <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and group <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> if the following holds (here we
assume <span class="math inline">\(k \neq 1\)</span>, although there is
a way to work around this):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta_k f = 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is real-analytic on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>transforms as a modular form of weight <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(z) = \sum_{n \gg - \infty} a_f(n)
q^n + \sum_{n &lt; 0} a_f^-(n) \Gamma(1 - k, 4 \pi n \Im(z))
q^n\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>An alternative way to describe the growth condition is that if you
apply a certain differential operator to this harmonic weak Maass form
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, namely, <span
class="math display">\[2 i \Im(z)^k \overline{\frac{\partial}{ \partial
\bar{z}} f},\]</span> you get a cusp form. An example is Ramanujan’s
mock theta functions. These were shown to be exactly the holomorphic
parts (i.e., the first sum) of these harmonic weak Maass forms.</p>
<p>Now: modularity of generating series of traces of CM values and
geodesic cycle integrals of “all types” of modular forms, with
applications. Of course there are examples of modular objects that are
not holomorphic on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> but
rather meromorphic. Before COVID (maybe 5,6,7 years ago): work with
Schwagenscheidt and Bringmann <a href="#ref-2018arXiv1810.00612" class="citation"
data-cites="2018arXiv1810.00612">(Alfes-Neumann, Bringmann, and

<h2 id="an-application-of-this-theory-in-the-hilbert-case">An
application of this theory in the Hilbert case</h2>
<p>These are not forms on one copy of the upper half-plane, but rather
two copies. Let</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>: real quadratic
field,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_F\)</span> its ring of
integers,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(D &gt; 0\)</span> the

<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{d}_F =(D)\)</span> its
different,</p></li>
<li><p>a variable <span class="math inline">\(Z =(z_1, z_2) \in
\mathbb{H}^2\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now we replace this notion of quadratic forms by (elements of)
lattices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set <span class="math display">\[L = \left\{
      \begin{pmatrix}
        a        &amp; v&#39; \\
        v &amp; b \\
      \end{pmatrix} : a, b \in \mathbb{H}, v \in \mathcal{O}_F
\right\},\]</span> equipped with the quadratic form <span
class="math inline">\(Q(X) = - \det(X)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set <span class="math display">\[L &#39; = \left\{
      \begin{pmatrix}
        a        &amp; v&#39; \\
        v &amp; b \\
      \end{pmatrix} : a, b \in \mathbb{H}, v \in \mathfrak{d}_F^{-1}
\right\}.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>We replace the role of the group <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span> by
that of <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathcal{O}_F)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We look at elements of the dual lattice that have determinant
<span class="math inline">\(- m / D\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[L_n = \left\{ X \in L &#39; : Q(X) = m / D
\right\}.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Now <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathcal{O}_F)\)</span>
acts on <span class="math inline">\(L_m\)</span> with finitely many
orbits. This is the kind of setup that gives us this notion of a trace
again.</p></li>
<li><p>We need replacements for the CM points and the geodesics. This
can again be seen as a special case of a way more general setup where
you look at orthogonal Shimura varieties and their special divisors;
this is the kinds of hands-on realization for the Hilbert case. We call
these analogues “algebraic cycles” for <span class="math inline">\(Q(X)
&lt; 0\)</span>: they are complex one-dimensional objects that again
have a very explicit description as a zero set <span
class="math display">\[T_X = \left\{ Z \in \mathbb{H}^2 : q_Z(X) = 0
\right\}.\]</span> As for geodesics, we take the real-analytic cycles:
for <span class="math inline">\(Q(y) &gt; 0\)</span>, we set <span
class="math display">\[C_y = \left\{  Z \in \mathbb{H}^2 : P Z(y) = 0
\right\}.\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>We now define the meromorphic Hilbert modular form that we want,
inspired by a paper of Zagier (I think his habilitation thesis), where
he defined these things but not the meromorphic ones, but rather Hilbert
cusp forms, given by summing over this polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(q_Z\)</span> that vanishes exactly at the cycle
<span class="math inline">\(C_y\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\omega_n^{\mathrm{mero}}(Z) = \sum_{X \in L_n}
  q_Z(X)^{- k}.\]</span> This is a meromorphic Hilbert modular form of
weight <span class="math inline">\((k, k)\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathcal{O}_F)\)</span>,
i.e., <span class="math display">\[\omega_n^{\mathrm{mero}}(\gamma_1
z_1, \gamma_2 z_2) = (c_1 z_1 + d_1)^k (c_2 z_2 + d_2)^k
\omega_1^{\mathrm{mero}}(Z),\]</span> with poles along all <span
class="math inline">\(T_X\)</span>’s. Our main theorem is then the
following.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 46</strong> (Alfes–Depouilly–Kiefer–Schwagenscheidt).
<em>Let <span class="math inline">\(k \geq 4\)</span> be even, <span

&lt; 0\)</span>. Then (taking the trace, which means summing over <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and integrating over the geodesics,
modding out by the appropriate stabilizer), the quantity <span
class="math display">\[\sum_{y \in \Gamma \backslash L_m} \int_{\Gamma_y
\backslash C_y} \omega_n^{\mathrm{mero}}(Z) q_Z(y)^{k - 1} \, d z_1 \, d
z_2\]</span> is a rational multiple of <span class="math inline">\(\pi
i\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>How does this relate to everything we proved before? These kind of
Shintani type lifts from orthogonal modular forms (integral weight to
half-integral in the <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span> case),
the speaker doesn’t know of any generalization of this Shintani type
result for cusp forms, but there wasn’t anything known for things that
behave worse than cusp forms or Eisenstein series, and these weakly
modular things indeed behave worse, so we had to find a way to get
around this. In the Hilbert case, this is a lot harder. The proof of
this result involves theta liftings and, these harmonic weak Maass forms
are related to cusp forms by this differential operator, and here we
need it to find preimages. Here the Koecher principle tells you that at
the cusp, you can’t get any singularities, so there will be no
meaningful notion of “harmonic weak” or “weakly holomorphic” because
there is simply no room for bad singularities at the cusp, so we had to
work with differential forms rather than functions, and somehow we
managed to swim around everything and in the end get this result about
these crazy things, showing that they are essentially rational.</p>
<p>Q: What about orthogonal forms? A: These might work for the case of
signature <span class="math inline">\((2, n)\)</span>. The differential
geometry will get so much harder in that generality.</p>
<p>Q: Can you get an estimate on the <em>size</em> of the rational
number produced by your theorem? A. Well, you write the number in
question as a combination of Fourier coefficients of harmonic weak Maass
forms and theta series. You can reduce to evaluating theta functions at
special cycles, something Kudla developed. Maybe there are results on
the sizes of these coefficients and you could combine this? Maybe it
would be possible.</p>

id="claudio-meneses-variations-of-selberg-zeta-functions-and-analytic-geometry-of-moduli-spaces">Claudio
Meneses, <em>Variations of Selberg zeta functions and analytic geometry
of moduli spaces</em></h2>
<p>(work in progress, joint with Hartmut Weiss)</p>
<p>Let’s start by talking about the relationship to moduli of the
Selberg zeta function for cofinite Fuchsian groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Gamma \leq
{\mathop{\mathrm{PSL}}}_2(\mathbb{R})\)</span>: cofinite Fuchsian group
(not necessarily cocompact)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\chi : \Gamma \rightarrow
\mathop{\mathrm{U}}(r)\)</span>: unitary representation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These will be understood as <em>moduli parameters</em>. “Moduli” here
means that we can continuously deform these objects. Today we fix <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> and deform <span
class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>. The Selberg zeta function is <span
class="math display">\[Z(s, \Gamma, \chi) := \prod_{\{\gamma\}} \prod_{k
= 1}^\infty \det \left( I - \chi(\gamma) e^{-(s + k) \ell(\gamma)}
\right).\]</span> Here</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> runs over
<em>primitive conjugacy classes</em> of hyperbolic elements of <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\ell(\gamma)\)</span>: length of
closed geodesic associated to <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>absolutely convergent for <span class="math inline">\(\Re(s) &gt;
1\)</span>, analytic continuation to <span class="math inline">\(s \in
\mathbb{C}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Geometric motivation: <em>analytic torsion</em>, an <em>analytic
invariant</em> associated to a <em>flat hermitian vector bundle</em>
that depends <em>non-trivially</em> on moduli parameters. The simplest
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-dimensional case is deeply
related to classical function theory. This goes back to work of
Ray–Singer. [The speaker shows the abstract from that article on a
slide.]</p>
<p>Now let’s say a little bit about the moduli. How can one combine this
moduli data for the Selberg zeta function into an algebro-geometric
problem? This goes by a combination of uniformization and the
Narasimhan–Seshadri theorem. Consider a compact Riemann surface of genus
<span class="math inline">\(&gt; 1\)</span>. Take a (stable) holomorphic
vector bundle <span class="math inline">\(E \rightarrow \Sigma\)</span>.
It turns out that one can construct such objects by starting with a
Fuchsian group uniforming the surface, and an irreducible representation
<span class="math inline">\(\rho : \Gamma \rightarrow
\mathop{\mathrm{U}}(r)\)</span>. This can be generalized to cofinite
Fuchsian groups (Mehta–Seshadri). Here (stable) parabolic vector bundles
<span class="math inline">\(E_\ast \rightarrow \Sigma_\ast\)</span>
correspond to irreducible representations <span
class="math inline">\(\rho : \Gamma \rightarrow
\mathop{\mathrm{U}}(r)\)</span>. Here</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_\ast\)</span> is the set of
all compact Riemann surfaces <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>
together with a finite subset <span class="math inline">\(\{z_1, \dotsc,
z_n\} \subset \Sigma\)</span> (we omit elliptic elements here to
simplify exposition).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>parabolic bundle</em> <span
class="math inline">\(E_\ast\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_\ast\)</span> consists of the following
data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a holomorphic vector bundle <span class="math inline">\(\pi : E
\rightarrow \Sigma\)</span> of rank <span class="math inline">\(r \geq
2\)</span> (with the latter assumption making the problem interesting
from the algebro-geometric side),</p></li>
<li><p>flags <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{- 1}(z_i) = E_{i 1}
\supseteq E_{i 2} \supseteq \dotsb \supseteq E_{i r} \supseteq
\{0\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i = 1, \dotsc, n\)</span>.
One is thinking of each of these as a cusp for the Fuchsian group. To
the fiber for these points one associates a descending flag. It need not
be complete; it can have multiplicities. To keep track of that, we
weight the flag by real numbers <span class="math display">\[0 \leq
\alpha_{i 1} \leq \dotsb \leq \alpha_{i r} &lt; 1.\]</span> The relevant
property of these weights is that on the algebro-geometric side, they
play the role of stability parameters. They can be deformed, giving rise
to deformation of the moduli problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We should point out that this extended local system <span
class="math inline">\(E_\ast\)</span> that one can construct from an
irreducible representation is equipped with a canonical (singular)
<em>hermitian metric</em> <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. This
leads to the construction of a <em>Laplace operator</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>. To construct this, one should
think of a punctured surface maybe, acting on some <span
class="math inline">\(L^2\)</span> space.</p>
<p>Something we should say is that in the parabolic case where we allow
marked points, there is no constraint on the genus of the surface, as
long as there is a hyperbolicity constraint that allows uniformization
by a Fuchsian group.</p>
<p>Now we would like to point out that from the Lie theoretic side, the
weights considered before actually determine <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> conjugacy classes in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{U}}(r)\)</span>, by taking <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{U}_i = \left[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      e^{2 \pi \sqrt{-1} \alpha_{i 1}}      &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; \dotsb &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; 0 &amp; e^{2 \pi \sqrt{- 1} \alpha_{i r}} \\
    \end{pmatrix} \right]
  \subseteq \mathop{\mathrm{U}}(r), \qquad
  i = 1, \dotsc, r.\]</span> This says how the flags arise from a local
system picture. From a more geometric side, this leads to what one can
call a relative character variety, which is just a space <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{K}_\alpha =
\mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(\Gamma,
\mathop{\mathrm{U}}(r))_\alpha^{\mathrm{irr}} /
\operatorname{PSU}(r).\]</span> This is a natural space of “moduli
parameters” for (say) the zeta function we want to consider, once we fix
the Fuchsian group. This depends upon a choice: we fix conjugacy classes
of parabolic generators (corresponding abstractly to generators for the
fundamental group of the punctured surface; not a problem because we are
fixing the Fuchsian group once and for all). The Mehta–Seshadri theorem
says that the relative character variety is diffeomorphic to the moduli
space of stable parabolic bundles with weights <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{N}_\alpha \cong
\mathcal{K}_\alpha\]</span>. The character variety is a smooth manifold,
while the moduli space of parabolic bundles is naturally a complex
manifold, so one is comparing objects from different universes. The
moduli space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}_\alpha\)</span>
comes endowed with a natural Kähler metric (which may be understood as a
symplectic structure compatible with the complex structure). We just
want to think of it as a positive <span class="math inline">\((1,
1)\)</span>-form <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_\alpha\)</span>.
This metric was originally introduced by Narasimhan (without parabolic
structures), but it’s in fact in the works of Petersson–Shimura–Weil.
The complex analytic interpretation of this Kähler structure is that we
can work with the local system and take endomorphisms, forming <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{End}}(E_0^\rho) \cong
E_0^{{\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}}_\rho}\)</span>, which is again a local system.
The way one constructs the Kähler structure <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_\alpha\)</span> is by inducing the <span
class="math inline">\(L^2\)</span>-metric on each <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}^{0, 1}(\Sigma_0,
\mathop{\mathrm{End}}(E_0^\rho))\)</span>. Here <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_0 := \Sigma - \{z_1, \dotsc, z_n\}\)</span>
is the punctured surface that one obtains, that has associated naturally
a local system. On the more analytic number theory side, we want to
emphasize that this hermitian inner product giving rise to the Kähler
metric is nothing but the Petersson inner product on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho\)</span>-automorphic
<span class="math inline">\((0, 1)\)</span>-forms.</p>
<p>We want to point out a question of S. J. Patterson, 1978 (the
question is so natural that it must have been in the air even before,
but this is the only place we’ve seen it stated). The question is
whether for arbitrary representations of a Fuchsian group is there any
relation between special values of the Selberg zeta function at <span
class="math inline">\(s = 1\)</span>, i.e., <span
class="math inline">\(Z_G(1, \chi)\)</span>, and interpretation in terms
of moduli spaces of vector bundles introduced by Weil, Narasimhan and
Mumford. We have a regularization of <span class="math inline">\(\det
\Delta\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{End}}E_0^\rho \cong
E_0^{\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho}\)</span>. Since the surface is
non-compact, there is continuous spectrum, so the usual regularization
trick doesn’t work, but this is what one can do with the Selberg zeta
function, which may be understood as a “second regularization” that gets
rid of the continuous spectrum. We then take <span
class="math inline">\(\lim_{s \rightarrow 1} Z(s, \Gamma,
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho)\)</span>. Here the parabolic structures give
rise to what we call tautological line bundles <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_{i j} \rightarrow
\mathcal{N}_\alpha\)</span>. How can one associate natural line bundles
to representations of a Fuchsian group of finite type? It’s generically
defined by the lines <span class="math inline">\(E_{i j} / E_{i j +
1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i = 1, \dotsc, n\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(j = 1, \dotsc, r\)</span>. This can be
understood on the representation side as follows. Look at one parabolic
generator <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i\)</span>, the value of
the representation <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\gamma_i)\)</span>
at this argument, and then diagonalize that, giving hermitian structures
on each <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{i j}\)</span>, hence
curvature <span class="math inline">\((1, 1)\)</span>-forms on <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_{i j}\)</span>. Here <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> runs through the punctures and <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> runs through the rank of the unitary
group, basically over the parabolic weights associated to a given
puncture. If we fix these two indices, we can associate an eigenvector
that is defined up to a phase. There is a construction of the curvature
<span class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span>-forms in terms of special
values <span class="math inline">\(E_i(\tau, v, 1)\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho\)</span>-Eisenstein–Maass
series. It turns out that these special values play the role of integral
kernels in defining these <span
class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span>-forms. From a geometric point of
view (which is the speaker’s interest), to understand the Ricci
curvature of these metrics <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_\alpha\)</span>, one can understand it as a
<span class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span>-form that represents the
first Chern class, <span class="math display">\[\Theta_\alpha \in - 2
\pi \sqrt{- 1} c_1(K_{\mathcal{N}_\alpha}).\]</span> Related to
curvature of Quillen metric on the index bundle <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda \rightarrow \mathcal{N}_\alpha\)</span>
for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(E_0^{\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho}\)</span>. Here one
can define the Quillen metric using the naturally induced <span
class="math inline">\(L^2\)</span>-metric (coming from the Kähler
metric), correcting it a bit: <span class="math display">\[\lVert .
\rVert_Q^2 := \lVert . \rVert_{L^2}^2 \left( \det \Delta \right)^{-1}
.\]</span></p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 47</strong> (Takhtajan–Zograf). <em>We have <span
class="math display">\[c_1 \left( \lambda, \lVert . \rVert_Q \right) = -
\frac{r}{ \pi^2} \Omega_\alpha + \delta_\alpha,\]</span> where <span
class="math display">\[\delta_\alpha = - \frac{2}{\pi} \sum_{i = 1}^n
\sum_{l, m = 1}^r \mathop{\mathrm{sgn}}(\alpha_{i l} - \alpha_{i m})
\left( 1 - 2 \lvert \alpha_{i l} - \alpha_{i m} \rvert \right) \Omega_{i
l}.\]</span></em></p>
</div>
<p>Even though we regularize <span class="math inline">\(\det
\Delta\)</span> by throwing away the continuous spectrum, the latter
comes back when we calculate the curvature of the Quillen metric in
terms of the cuspidal defect, because the contributions of the latter
are defined using special values of Eisenstein series. So the continuous
spectrum is somehow hidden in the regularization. Geometrically (or
maybe what’s interesting to me) is that here <span
class="math inline">\(\log \det \Delta\)</span> has an interpretation as
a <em>Ricci potential</em>, i.e., it actually gives a comparison between
Kähler forms: <span class="math display">\[- \frac{r}{\pi^2}
\Omega_\alpha + \delta_\alpha = \frac{\sqrt{- 1}}{2 \pi} \left(
\Theta_\alpha + \partial \bar{\partial} \log \det \Delta
\right).\]</span></p>
<p>Now let’s go to the second part of the talk. What we considered
before was some sort of geometric interpretation of the deformation of
the special values of the Selberg zeta function by fixing the Fuchsian
group and allowing the representation to change. To define the moduli
space, we had to fix the parabolic weights. What we want to consider now
is the subsequent problem of considering deformations of these parabolic
weight parameters (or conjugacy classes in the unitary group). We are
thus interested in the behavior of analytic invariants under variations
of parabolic weights/conjugacy classes.</p>
<div class="remark">
<p><strong>Remark 48</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Parabolic weights are parametrized as points in a <em>convex
polytope</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}\)</span> may be thought
of a some sort of space of conjugacy classes of puncture generators.
Something may happen in the case of genus zero which is that not every
collection of conjugacy classes can be realized by a stable parabolic
bundle, but for arbitrary genus <span class="math inline">\(&gt;
0\)</span>, that’s always the case.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}_\alpha\)</span> is
<em>generically compact</em>. The interesting part is that if one looks
at all these semi-stability walls that one can define on this polytope
and removes their union, the coplement is actually a finite collection
of convex simplices, and when one chooses parabolic weights on each of
these simplices, the resulting moduli space is compact.</p></li>
<li><p>As we just said: the existence of strictly semi-stable points
gives rise to semi-stability walls in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}\)</span>, with the complement being
finitely many open chambers <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The biholomorphism type of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}_\alpha\)</span> is an <em>open chamber
invariant</em> – it only changes when we cross a wall.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>From the formula of Takhtajan–Zograf, we get variation of the class
<span class="math inline">\([\Omega_\alpha]\)</span> in the Kähler cone
of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}_\alpha\)</span>, while the
classes <span class="math inline">\(c_1(K_{cn_\alpha})\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(c_1(\lambda_{i j})\)</span> are locally
rigid. The variation in cohomology is measured entirely by the variation
in the Kähler cone. A <em>finer interpretation</em> concerns what we
call the total character variety. Consider arbitrary representations
without fixing conjugacy classes of parabolic generators. By
construction, this space (or set, for now) is going to have a natural
projection to the weight polytope <span class="math display">\[\pi :
\mathcal{K} \rightarrow \mathcal{W}.\]</span> That is, if we fix an
arbitrary irreducible representation and look at its conjugation class,
we can look at what the conjugacy classes of parabolic generators are,
and in this way we can project to the weight polytope. This space is
going to be not quite as nice; it’ll be a (singular) Poisson manifold.
It’s nice away from semi-stability walls. The fibers <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}_\alpha = \pi^{-1}(\alpha)\)</span> are
symplectic leaves with respect to some natural Poisson structure (for
fixed conjugacy classes of parabolic generators).</p>
<p>One can read this infinitesimally as follows, at <span
class="math inline">\([\rho] \in \mathcal{K}_\alpha \subseteq
\mathcal{K}\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[T_{[\rho]}
\mathcal{K} = H^1(\pi_1(\Sigma_0), \mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho)\]</span>
(group cohomology). There’s actually a way to model the vertical tangent
space, that is, that which actually stays within a given conjugacy class
without changing it. Here we need to impose a further “parabolic cycle”
constraint, giving <span class="math display">\[T_{[\rho]}
\mathcal{K}_\alpha = H_P^1(\pi_1(\Sigma_0),
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho).\]</span> The complex-analytic structures that
we want to consider, after Weil and Shimura, are associated to these
previously-defined vector spaces. They are so-called <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{End}}(\mathbb{C}^r)\)</span>-valued
automorphic forms of weight <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.
These are functions <span class="math inline">\(\phi : \mathbb{H}
\rightarrow \mathop{\mathrm{End}}(\mathbb{C}^r)\)</span> that satisfy
the transformation rule <span class="math display">\[\phi(\gamma \tau)
\gamma &#39;(\tau)= \mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho(\gamma) \cdot \phi(\tau),
\qquad \tau \in \mathbb{H}, \gamma \in \Gamma.\]</span> We require the
following two behaviors as we approach a cusp:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>regular</em>: <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{\tau
\rightarrow \tau_i} \phi(\tau)\)</span> exists. (Note that it has to be
holomorphic.)</p></li>
<li><p><em>cusp</em>: <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{\tau \rightarrow
\tau_i} \phi(\tau) = 0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What’s important to us is the classical Shimura isomorphism, which
associates to any of these cusp forms an Eichler integral by choosing a
reference point: <span class="math display">\[\phi \mapsto
\mathcal{E}_\phi(\tau) := \int_{\tau_0}^\tau \phi(w) \, d w.\]</span>
Note that when we change the reference point, the cohomology class of
the associated object will not change even though the integral itself
will change. The transformation rule for the Eichler integral is almost
automorphic, but with a correction term: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{E}_\phi(\gamma \tau) =
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho \cdot \mathcal{E}_\phi(\tau) +
z_\phi(\gamma),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(z_\phi :
\Gamma \rightarrow \mathop{\mathrm{End}}(\mathbb{C}^r)\)</span> is a
group cohomology <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-cocycle. Here
the version of the Shimura isomorphism that we want to consider is the
one that takes the real part <span class="math display">\[\phi
\mapsto[\Re(z_\phi)].\]</span> (Here one has to be careful how to define
the real part. We do so with respect to the real structure defining the
Lie algebra here. Here we’re thinking of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{End}}(\mathbb{C}^r)\)</span> as
the complexification of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{u}(n)\)</span>.) One can naturally
identify <span class="math display">\[H^1(\pi_1(\Sigma_0),
{\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}}_\rho) \cong
\overline{\mathfrak{M}_2^{\mathbb{R}}(\Gamma,
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho)}.\]</span> We also have <span
class="math display">\[H^1_P(\pi_1(\Sigma_0), {\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}}_\rho)
  \cong
  \overline{\mathfrak{S}_2(\Gamma, \mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho)}.\]</span>
Let’s just say that the Petersson inner product (defined in general
between regular forms and cusp forms) leads to a Hodge projection (even
though the Petersson inner product is not always defined between two
regular forms)’: <span class="math display">\[\mathfrak{M}_2(\Gamma,
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho) \rightarrow \mathfrak{S}_2(\Gamma,
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho),\]</span> which in turn gives rise to a
splitting <span class="math display">\[H^1(\pi_1(\Sigma_0),
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho) \cong \overline{\mathfrak{S}_2(\Gamma,
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho)} \oplus
\overline{\mathcal{E}_2^{\mathbb{R}}(\Gamma,
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho)},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}_2(\Gamma,
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho)\)</span> is a holomorphic Eisenstein series of
weight <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Geometrically, we opbtain
fiberwise complex structures <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}_\alpha \cong
\mathcal{N}_\alpha\)</span>, and a flat connection on open chambers
<span class="math inline">\(\pi \mid_{\mathcal{C}} : \mathcal{N}
\rightarrow \mathcal{C}\)</span>, which gives rise to real horizontal
coordinates. [There is a picture, where the weight polytope is at the
bottom and looking a bit complicated, and where the fibers at the walls
may become singular, but as long as we stay within a chamber, the fibers
are smooth complex manifolds. The Shimura isomorphism allows us to form
an orthogonal complement by which we may take derivatives along
horizontal directions.]</p>
<p>The resolvent kernel of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>
on <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{End}}E_0^\rho\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[G_s(\tau, \tau &#39;) = \sum_{\gamma \in
\Gamma} Q_s(\tau, \gamma \tau &#39;)
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho(\gamma).\]</span> One can construct a Green’s
function <span class="math display">\[G(\tau, \tau &#39;) = \lim_{s
\rightarrow 1} \left( G_s(\tau, \tau &#39;) - \frac{1}{s(s - 1)}
\frac{1}{ \pi r(2 g - 2 + n)} \mathop{\mathrm{id}}\right).\]</span> If
we subtract the scalar multiple of the identity by the standard
resolvent on the upper half-plane, one can desingularize it: <span
class="math display">\[\Psi(\tau) := \frac{\partial}{ \partial \tau
&#39;} \left( G(\tau, \tau &#39;) - Q(\tau, \tau &#39;) \right)
\mid_{\tau &#39; = \tau}\]</span> is a <em>smooth</em> regular
automorphic form of weight <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> that
encodes deep geometric information.</p>
<p>Takhtajan–Zograf first variation of the Selberg zeta function: let
<span class="math inline">\(\{E^\rho\} \in \mathcal{N}_\alpha\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\mu \in \overline{\mathfrak{S}_2(\Gamma,
\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho)} \cong T_{\{E^\rho\}}
\mathcal{N}_\alpha\)</span>. Then <span class="math display">\[\partial
\log \det \Delta \left( \frac{\partial}{ \partial \varepsilon(\mu)}
\right) = - \sqrt{- 1}\int_{\Sigma_0} \mathop{\mathrm{trace}}\left(
\mathop{\mathrm{ad}}\mu \wedge \Psi \right) y^2 \, d V_{\mathbb{H}} =
\langle \mathop{\mathrm{ad}}\mu, \ast \Psi \rangle_P.\]</span> So the
resolvent knows the geometry of the variation of the Selberg zeta
function.</p>
<p>M.-Weiss extended first variation of Selberg zeta function. For
generic parabolic weights <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in
\mathcal{C}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{E^\rho\} \in
\mathcal{N}_\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu \in

\right\rangle_P^{\mathop{\mathrm{reg}}}
  + \sum_{i = 1}^n \left\langle \mathop{\mathrm{ad}}\mu, \ast \theta_i
\right\rangle_P^{\mathop{\mathrm{reg}}},\]</span> where the correction
term is related to the presence of cusps. We want to emphasize that
these inner products are no longer well-defined. They are instead
defined with respect to the Rankin–Selberg regularization of Zagier. It
uses special values <span class="math inline">\(E_i(\tau, v, 2)\)</span>
of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho\)</span>-Eisenstein–Maass
series. The correction terms involve <span
class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span>, which are <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho\)</span>-automorphic
incomplete theta series for the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\mathop{\mathrm{Ad}}\rho(\gamma_i)\)</span>-invariant
part of the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>th Fourier
coefficients of <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>. This is of
course an incomplete story, because one can consider first (and higher)
variational formulas for <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_\alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_{i j}\)</span>, which are direct
by-products. But let’s talk about something else in the remaining time.
For <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_0 = \mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^1 -
\{z_1, \dotsc, z_n\}\)</span>, M.–Takhtajan: critical values of
hermitian WZNW action defin a smooth function <span

\beta_{i j} \Omega_{i j} \right) \mid_{\mathcal{N}_{0,
\alpha}},\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_{ ij}\)</span>: linear on
parabolic weights, splitting coefficients of <span

class="math inline">\(\Omega_\alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{i, j} \beta_{i j} \Omega_{i

<li><p>Moreover, <span class="math inline">\(\partial S\)</span> is a
Hodge projection of corresponding families of unitary Fuchsian systems
on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^1 - \{z_1, \dotsc,

<li><p>Caveat: the dependence of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}_{0, \alpha} \subset

let’s say, a motivation for trying to understand the problem we’ll
describe in the last five minutes of the talk.</p></li>

<p>Hyper–Kähler corresponds to Kähler and complex symplectic. That is,
it should mean “complexification of a Kähler structure”. One can
parametrize it by a Kähler structure and a complex symplectic structure
that are compatible in the same way that a Kähler structure can be
understood as a Riemann metric and a symplectic structure that are
compatible.</p>

weights (in progress: apply variation of Ricci potentials). The expected
correspondence is that the semistability wall degeneration should
correspond to formation of conical singularities. It would be desirable
to further and find a geometric model for the metric’s

id="zeynab-ebrahimi-classification-of-the-hilbert-modular-varieties-and-quaternionic-shimura-varieties">Zeynab
Ebrahimi, <em>Classification of the Hilbert modular varieties and
quaternionic Shimura varieties</em></h1>
<p>For dimension <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, we mean up to
birational classes. For larger dimensions, we mean to compute the
Kodaira dimension.</p>
<p>We start with the following:</p>
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 51</strong>. Is it possible to classify the Hilbert
modular varieties?</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s start with the definition of Hilbert modular varieties.</p>
<p>Then we’ll define quaternionic Shimura varieties.</p>
<p>Then we’ll give some classification results for each, and some idea
of the proof.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> be a totally real number
field, of degree <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> over the
rational numbers. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_K\)</span>
denote its ring of integers. The group <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma_K :=
{\mathop{\mathrm{PSL}}}_2(\mathcal{O}_K)\)</span> is called the
<em>Hilbert modular group</em>. It acts on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{H}^n\)</span>. We denote by <span
class="math inline">\(X_K := \Gamma_K \backslash \mathbb{H}^n\)</span>
the orbit space. By compactifying <span
class="math inline">\(X_K\)</span> (adding finitely many cusps), we
obtain <span class="math inline">\(Y_K\)</span>, a projective variety
(in general, singular). We refer to both <span
class="math inline">\(X_K\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Y_K\)</span> as <em>Hilbert modular
varieties</em>. By resolution of singularities applied to <span
class="math inline">\(Y_K\)</span>, we obtain <span
class="math inline">\(Z_K\)</span>, a <em>smooth model of the Hilbert
modular variety</em>.</p>
<p>More generally, let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be an
indefinite quaternion algebra over <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span> be any order of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and let <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}^1\)</span> denote the group of norm
one units of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>. Then
<span class="math display">\[A \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathbb{R} \cong
M_2(\mathbb{R})^m \times \mathcal{D}^{n - m}.\]</span> Moreover, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}^1\)</span> is a discrete subgroup of
<span class="math inline">\(A \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathbb{R}\)</span>,
so we can project to the first <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>
factors, giving another group that we call <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>. The orbit space <span
class="math inline">\(X_\Gamma = \Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}^m\)</span>
is called the <em>quaternionic Shimura variety</em>.</p>
<p>Note that if we just take <span class="math inline">\(A =
M_2(K)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(X_\Gamma =
X_K\)</span>. Thus the quaternionic Shimura case generalizes the Hilbert
modular case.</p>
<p>Since the classification results we’ll present depend upon the
Kodaira dimension, let’s define that. Let <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a smooth variety of dimension <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(K_X =
\Lambda^n \Omega_X^1\)</span> denote the canonical bundle of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (here <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_X^1\)</span> denotes the cotangent bundle).
For <span class="math inline">\(d \geq 0\)</span>, the <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-th plurigenus <span
class="math inline">\(P_d\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the dimension of the space of global
sections of <span class="math inline">\(K_X^d\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[P_d := \dim H^0(X, K_X^d).\]</span> One important
application of these invariants is that they may be used to determine
when algebraic varieties may be rational. By the way, being rational for
a variety means that it is birationally equivalent to the projective
space. Note that to show that a variety cannot be rational, it suffices
to identify one nonzero plurigenus.</p>
<p>The <em>Kodaira dimension</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> is defined to be <span
class="math display">\[\kappa =
  \begin{cases}
    - \infty    &amp; \text{ if } P_d = 0 \text{ for all } d &gt; 0, \\
    \min \{k : P_d = \operatorname{O}(d^k)\}           &amp; \text{
otherwise}.
  \end{cases}\]</span> One way to interpret this definition is that the
Kodaira dimension measures the rate of growth of the plurigenera, which
we defined a bit earlier. Also, Kodaira dimension can be either <span
class="math inline">\(- \infty\)</span> or an integer between <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dim
X\)</span>.</p>
<p>One may ask, how can we classify Hilbert modular varieties in
dimension two, or Hilbert modular surfaces? An algebraic variety <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is said to be of <em>general type</em>
if <span class="math inline">\(\kappa(X) = \dim(X)\)</span>. Those of
general type seem too complicated to be classified. Usually the way that
we deal with such varieties is we try to determine which varieties are
of general type, and then just somehow ignore them, and try to classify
other varieties that are more simple.</p>
<p>There is a result that tells us for precisely which discriminants
these four cases can happen. Let <span class="math inline">\(K =
\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\)</span> be a real quadratic field of discriminant
<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(Z_K\)</span> denote the canonical smooth model of
the Hilbert modular surface associated with the field <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Then the following ultimate
classification result holds:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Z_K\)</span> is rational if <span
class="math inline">\(D = 5,8,12,13,17,21,24,28,33,60\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Z_K\)</span> is a blow-up of a <span
class="math inline">\(K_3\)</span>-surface if <span
class="math inline">\(D =29,37,40,41,44,56,57,69,105\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Z_K\)</span> is a blow-up of an
honestly elliptic surface if <span class="math inline">\(D =
53,61,65,73,76,77,85,88,92,93,120,140,165\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>(...)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 6\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(Z_K\)</span> is of general type.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(n \leq 6\)</span>, there are only
finitely many exceptional fields <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(Z_K\)</span> is <em>not</em> of
general type.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For a quaternion algebra <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, if
<span class="math inline">\(A \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathbb{R} \cong
M_2(\mathbb{R}) \times \dotsb \times M_2(\mathbb{R})\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is called a <em>totally
definite</em> quaternion algebra. Now, we cansomehow classify the
Shimura varieties. Let <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>
denote the group of norm one units of a maximal order of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and considered the corresponding
quaternionic Shimura variety <span class="math inline">\(X_\Gamma =
\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}^n\)</span> with smooth model <span
class="math inline">\(Z_\Gamma\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 6\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(Z_\Gamma\)</span> is of general type.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(n \leq 6\)</span>, there are only
finitely many exceptional fields <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(Z_\Gamma\)</span> is <em>not</em>
of general type.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s give a rough idea of how we can prove the latter theorem. We
have to prove that for <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 6\)</span>, we
have <span id="eq:cnrbhlraia" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnrbhlraia}\tag{9.1}
  P_d = \operatorname{O}(d^n).\]</span> Now</p>
<ul>
<li><p>From the definition, we have <span class="math inline">\(P_d =
\dim H^0(Z_\Gamma, K_{Z_\Gamma}^d)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If we take <span class="math inline">\(f \in A(\Gamma)_{2
d}\)</span>, then we can extend <span class="math inline">\(f
\omega^{\otimes d}\)</span> to a section of <span
class="math inline">\(H^0(Z_\Gamma, K_{Z_\Gamma}^d)\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(\omega = d z_1 \wedge \dotsb \wedge d
z_n\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, this cohomology is the same as the space of global sections
of the sheaf of differential forms, and we know that this <span
class="math inline">\(f \omega^{\otimes d}\)</span> – where <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is just an automorphic form – behaves
like a differential form. But on this <span
class="math inline">\(X_\Gamma\)</span>, we don’t know that this <span
class="math inline">\(f \omega^{\otimes d}\)</span> behaves like a
differential form on the <em>smooth</em> model <span
class="math inline">\(Z_\Gamma\)</span>. If we can check that this is
true, then we can claim that we can extend <span class="math inline">\(f
\omega^{\otimes d}\)</span> to a section of the sheaf <span
class="math inline">\(H^0(Z_\Gamma, K_{Z_\Gamma}^d)\)</span>. We now
explain why we can do that. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(p \in
X_\Gamma\)</span> is a singular point. Before resolving this singular
point, we usually replace this point by some subvariety of curve which
is locally isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^n /
\Gamma_P\)</span>, where we quotient by the stabilizer <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma_P\)</span>. This <span
class="math inline">\(f \omega^{\otimes d}\)</span> is also a
differential form on the resolution of this singularity by a theorem of
Tai (?). We wanted to prove <a href="#eq:cnrbhlraia"
data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnrbhlraia">\((9.1)\)</a>. We know that <span
class="math display">\[\dim A(\Gamma)_{2 d} \leq \dim H^0(Z_\Gamma,
K_{z_\Gamma}^d) \implies \dim A(\Gamma)_{2 d} \leq P_d\]</span> by some
paper of someone, and some other inequality by some other paper, which
combine to give the required estimate.</p>

id="caner-nazaroglu-averaging-to-higher-depth-mock-modular-forms">Caner
Nazaroglu, <em>Averaging to higher depth mock modular forms</em></h1>
<p>As the title suggests, this talk will be a natural continuation of
this morning’s theme of discussing generalizations of modular forms.
This is joint and ongoing work with K. Bringmann on higher rank
generalizations of mock modular forms.</p>
<p>On a quadratic form <span class="math inline">\(Q(x, y) = a x^2 + b x
y + c y^2\)</span> with integer coefficients, we have the standard
action of the modular group. The Hurwitz class number <span
class="math inline">\(H(N)\)</span> is the number of classes of
discriminant <span class="math inline">\(-N\)</span>, weighted by their
stabilizer. The generating function <span
class="math display">\[h_\alpha(\tau) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty H(4 n + 3
\alpha) q^{n + \frac{3 \alpha}{4}}.\]</span> Zagier showed that <span
class="math inline">\(h_\alpha\)</span> is the holomorphic part of a
mock modular form <span class="math display">\[\hat{h}_\alpha(\tau,
\bar{\tau}) := h_\alpha(\tau) - \frac{3 i}{ 4 \sqrt{2} \pi}
  \int_{- \bar{\tau}}^{i \infty}
  \frac{\vartheta_{1, \alpha}(w)}{(- i(w + \tau))^{3/2}} \, d
w.\]</span> To do this, he constructed an appropriate Eisenstein
series.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about Zagier’s weight <span
class="math inline">\(3/2\)</span> Eisenstein series. Zagier studied the
Eisenstein series <span class="math display">\[\hat{f}_{m, \mu}(\tau,
\bar{\tau}, s) := \frac{v^s}{2}
  \sum_{(c, d) \in \Lambda}
  \frac{\Psi_m(M_{c, d})_{0, \mu}}{ \lvert c \tau + d \rvert^{2 s}(c
\tau + d)^{3/2}}.\]</span> For <span class="math inline">\(\Re(s) &gt;
1/2\)</span>, this is holomorphic in <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and a <em>real analytic modular
form</em> in <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. More crucially,
it analytically continues to <span class="math inline">\(s = 0\)</span>
and yields a modular completion of a mock modular form there. In
particular, taking <span class="math inline">\(m = 1\)</span> recovers
Zagier’s result.</p>
<p>The easiest way to see the analytic continuation is to decompose into
a Fourier series <span class="math display">\[- \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z} -
\frac{\mu^2}{4 m}}
  e^{2 \pi i \tau n}
  \mathcal{L}_{m, \mu}(n, 2 s + 2)
  \mathcal{I}(v, n, s)\]</span> where we have a separation into the
<em>arithmetic contribution</em> <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{L}_{m, \mu}(n, s) = e^{\pi i /4} \sum_{c
= 1}^\infty c^{- s + 1/2} \sum_{d(c)^\ast}
  \Psi_m(M_{c, d})_{0, \mu} e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{d}{c}n}\]</span> and the
analytic contribution <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{I}(v, n, s)
= v^{- s - 1/2} e^{2 \pi n v} \int \frac{e^{- 2 x pi x n v}}{(1 - i
x)^{3/2}(1 + x^2)^s} \, d x.\]</span> These can be separately
analytically continued. Expressing the Weil multiplier in terms of Gauss
sums, we can write write the arithmetic part as <span
class="math display">\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 m}}
  \frac{L(\chi_{- 4 m n}, 2 s + 1)}{ \zeta(4 s + 2)}
  \prod_{p : \text{bad}}
  \mathcal{B}_{p, m, \mu}(n, 2 s + 1).\]</span> Every ingredient here
has a meromorphic extension to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>. At <span
class="math inline">\(s = 0\)</span>, the arithmetic part is
<em>holomorphic</em> except when <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{- 4 m
n}\)</span> is principal (i.e., when <span class="math inline">\(- 4 m
n\)</span> is a square) where it develops a <em>simple pole</em>.</p>
<p>The analytic part is already manifestly holomorphic for <span
class="math inline">\(\Re(s) &gt; -1/4\)</span>, and can be expressed
explicitly in terms of Whittaker functions. On compact subsets for <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and for <span
class="math inline">\(\lvert n \rvert \gg 1\)</span>, we have uniform
bounds <span class="math display">\[e^{- 2 \pi n v} \mathcal{I}(v, n, s)
\ll \lvert n \rvert^D e^{- 2 \pi \lvert n \rvert v}.\]</span> At <span
class="math inline">\(s = 0\)</span>, we have no <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> dependence! By deforming the contour,
one sees that <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{I}(v, n, 0) =
  \begin{cases}
    4 \pi \sqrt{2 n} &amp;  \text{ if } n &gt; 0, \\
    0 &amp; \text{ if } n \leq 0.
  \end{cases}\]</span> This is what leads to (when <span
class="math inline">\(m = 1\)</span>) <span class="math display">\[f_{1,
\alpha}(\tau) = - 12 \sum_{n = 0}^\infty H(4 n + 3 \alpha) q^{n +
\frac{3 \alpha}{4}}.\]</span> This explains why we get a generating
function for Hurwitz class numbers.</p>
<p>This is the holomorphic part of this object, but we still have to
deal with the pole. This is what leads to the interesting mock modular
behavior of this function. Multiplying the simple pole from the
arithmetic part and the zero of the analytic part, where the <span
class="math inline">\(\operatorname{O}(s)\)</span> term is <span
class="math display">\[\partial_s \mathcal{I}(v, n, 0) = \frac{\pi
\sqrt{2}}{ \sqrt{v}} \int_1^\infty x^{- 3/2} e^{- 4 \pi \lvert n \rvert
v x} \, d x,\]</span> gives a nonvanishing contribution. These yield the
usual error functions that we see in the completions of mock modular
forms.</p>
<p>In practice, we have to work with slightly more general objects. A
<em>mixed mock modular form</em> <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>
of weight <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> has a modular
completion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{h}(\tau,
\bar{\tau})\)</span> that satisfies <span
class="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{ \partial \bar{\tau}} \hat{h} \in
\bigoplus_j \tau_2^{r_j} \mathfrak{M}_{k + r_j} \otimes
\overline{\mathfrak{M}_{2 + r_j}}.\]</span> (Here, of course, as your
problem requires, you need to insert any set of adjectives (weakly,
holomorphic, etc) – we’re being a little vague here, but besides that,
this is what we mean.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Such objects can be constructed using indefinite theta functions
of Zwegers over signature <span class="math inline">\((n - 1,
1)\)</span> lattices.</p></li>
<li><p>We now have a generalization for lattices with signature <span
class="math inline">\((n - r, r)\)</span>: Alexandrov, Banerjee,
Manschot, Pioline ’16, N. ’16, Kudla 16, Funke–Kudla ’17,
Zagier–Zwegers.</p></li>
<li><p>The indefinite theta functions more generally fit into the space
<span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}_k^d\)</span> of mock modular
forms with weight <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and depth <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, with the space of their modular
completions <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathfrak{M}}_k^d\)</span>.
This is defined recursively starting with <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}_k^0  = \hat{\mathfrak{M} }_k^0 =
\mathfrak{M}_k\)</span> and then requiring <span
class="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{\tau}} \hat{h} \in
\bigoplus_j \tau_2^{r_j} \hat{\mathfrak{M}}_{k + r_j}^{d - 1}
    \otimes \overline{\mathfrak{M}_{2 + r_j}}.\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s give some examples. Vafa–Witten theory (1995) is a
topologically twisted four dimensional <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N} = 4\)</span> super Yang–Mills
theory.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^2\)</span>
and with <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{U}}(2)\)</span>
gauge group, the partition function is given by (Klyachko ’91, Yoshioka
’94-95) <span class="math display">\[f_{2, \alpha}(\tau) =
\frac{3^\alpha(\tau)}{ \eta(\tau)^6}.\]</span> So you’re seeing the
appearance of a mock modular form already in this context. More
recently, this is work discussing how the non-holomorphic part can be
obtain from boundary term contributions in that partition function
calculation.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{U}}(3)\)</span>
gauge group, we have <span class="math inline">\(f_{3, \mu}(\tau) =
\frac{h_{3, \mu}(\tau)}{\eta(\tau)^9}\)</span> with explicit formulas
given by Toda, Manschot, Kool, Weist, e.g., <span
class="math display">\[h_{3, 0}(\tau) = \frac{1}{9} - q + 3 q^2 + 1 7
q^3 + 41 q^4 + 78 q^5 + 120 q^6 + 193 q 7 + \dotsb,\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[h_{3, \pm 1}(\tau) = 3 q^{5/3} + 15 q^{8/3} + 36
q^{11/3} + 69 q^{14/3} + 114 q^{17/3} + 165 q^{20/3} + \dotsb.\]</span>
This has a modular completion (Maschot ’17) <span
class="math display">\[\hat{h}_{3, \mu}(\tau, \bar{\tau}) = h_{3,
\mu}(\tau) - \frac{9 \sqrt{3} i}{2 \sqrt{2} \pi}
    \sum_{\alpha \pmod{2}}
    \int_{- \bar{\tau}}^{i \infty}
    \frac{\hat{h}_\alpha(\tau, - w)
      \vartheta_{3, 2 \mu + 3 \alpha}(w)}{\left( - i(w + \tau)
\right)^{3/2}} \, d w.\]</span> You can use these modular properties to
get information about the Fourier coefficients of these objects, but
we’ll skip that for the sake of time.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 52</strong>. Can Zagier’s construction be
generalized to higher depth?</p>
</div>
<p>A trivial observation: the trivial depth two mock modular form <span
class="math inline">\(f_{m_1, \mu_1}(\tau) f_{m_2, \mu_2}(\tau)\)</span>
comes from multiplying their series definitions. The combination <span
class="math display">\[8 h_{3, \mu}(\tau) - \sum_{\alpha \in \{0, 1\}}
  f_{1, \alpha}(\tau) f_{3, 2 \mu + 3 a}(\tau)\]</span> has the <em>same
shadow</em> as the depth two mock modular form we are aiming for.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our double Eisenstein series will also have a vanishing constant
mode in the holomorphic part. There is a unique holomorphic modular form
at this weight and multiplier system: the <em>theta function</em> for
the <span class="math inline">\(E_6\)</span> lattice (also an Eisenstein
series). This fixes our target depth two mock modular form as <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{T}_\mu(\tau) := 8 h_{3 , \mu}(\tau) -
\sum_{\alpha \in \{0, 1\}}
    f_{1, \alpha}(\tau) \dotsb.\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>A new ingredient for double Eisenstein series is the existence of the
<em>invariant cross ratio</em> <span class="math display">\[y =
\frac{c_1 \tau + d_1}{c_1 \bar{\tau} + d_1}
  \frac{c_2 \bar{\tau} + d_2}{ c_2 \tau + d_2},\]</span> or
equivalently, <span id="eq:cnrbhnjf3e" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnrbhnjf3e}\tag{10.1}
  x = i \frac{y + 1}{y - 1}
  = \frac{c_1 c_2 \lvert \tau \rvert^2 +(c_1 d_2 + c_2 d_1) u + d_1
d_2}{ v(c_1 d_2 - c_2 d_1)}.\]</span> This has natural invariance and
homogeneity properties. Our proposal: <span
class="math display">\[\hat{H}_{m, \mu}(\tau, \bar{\tau}, s) = \frac{i s
v^{2 s}}{2}
  \sum_{
    \substack{
      (c_1 , d_1), (c_2, d_2) \in \Lambda  \\
      c_1 d_2 - c_2 d_1 \neq 0      
    }
  }
  \dotsb.\]</span> (...)</p>
<p>We still have a complicated object, but for <span
class="math inline">\(c_1, c_2 &gt; 0\)</span>, writing the right hand
side of <a href="#eq:cnrbhnjf3e" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnrbhnjf3e">\((10.1)\)</a> as <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{x_1 x_2 + 1}{ x_2 - x_1}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(x_j := \frac{u + \tfrac{d_j}{c_j}}{v}\)</span>, we
can separate the interaction term as <span id="eq:cnrbhnlztp" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnrbhnlztp}\tag{10.2}
  \arctan(x_1) - \arctan(x_2) + \frac{\pi}{2} \mathop{\mathrm{sgn}}(x_2
- x_1),\]</span> leading to an expression for <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span>. A quick sketch: for the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th Fourier coefficient, we have a
decomposition into</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the arithmetic parts <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_{m_1, \mu_1}(n - k)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_{m_2, \mu_2}(k)\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>the analytic part, which vanishes for <span
class="math inline">\(n \leq 0\)</span>, and</p></li>
<li><p>an infinite sum over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, slow
due to the sign term in <a href="#eq:cnrbhnlztp"
data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnrbhnlztp">\((10.2)\)</a>, which leads to many
technical issues.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The structure is roughly that for <span class="math inline">\(n &gt;
0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n &lt; 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n \leq 0\)</span>, the three parts just mentioned
are respectively asymptotic to</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(1, 1, 1/s\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(1/s, 1, 1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(1/s\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>:non-holomorphic <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the rough outline. Our main result (in progress) is that,
defining <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{H}_\mu(\tau) :=
\sum_{\alpha \in \{0, 1\}} H_{(1, 3),(\alpha, 2 \mu + 3
\alpha)}(\tau)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mu \in
\mathbb{Z} / 3 \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, the condition on the shadow and the
<span class="math inline">\(q^0\)</span> term gives <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_\mu(\tau) =
\mathcal{T}_\mu(\tau)\)</span>, and we obtain an expression for the
Fourier coefficients of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_\mu\)</span> in terms of Hurwitz class
numbers.</p>
<p>We also obtain some numerical results and graph them.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, this is a new way to construct depth two mock
modular forms and already within the example we considered, we are led
to alternative expressions for the Fourier coefficients and this results
in identities when compare d with the constructions from indefinite
theta functions. What else can we get from the interplay between these
two constructions ?</p>
<p>Many generalizations are now possible. What can we say about the
space of depth two mock modular forms with these?</p>
<p>We hope also to investigate the interplay with holomorphic
projection, and even higher depth.</p>

<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(W = {\mathop{\mathrm{Res}}}_{E /

isotropic decomposition <span class="math inline">\(W = W_1 \oplus
W_2\)</span>. For any Schwartz–Bruhat function <span

have the associated theta series is the sum <span

in fact an automorphic form on this product group, i.e., <span
class="math inline">\(\theta_\phi \in \mathcal{A}(H \times G)\)</span>.
Now for an automorphic form <span class="math inline">\(f \in

Rallis, Kudla, Gan, Qiu, Takeda, Yamana, etc.</p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll take a specific automorphic form <span

properties, e.g., checking if the theta lift is nonzero modulo <span

<p>We restrict ourselves to unitary pairs: <span

<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>. We fix <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{C}_p \supset

irreducible algebraic representation <span

<span class="math inline">\(f \in \mathcal{A}_\lambda(H, K_H)\)</span>
(here <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the weight, <span
class="math inline">\(K_H\)</span> is the level), we define the <span

<p>We say that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <span

<p>Similarly, for <span class="math inline">\(F \in \mathcal{A}_\tau(G,

<p>The speaker hopes this will be a suitable Friday evening talk.</p>
<p>Let’s introduce things with a number-theoretic example. Consider
<span class="math inline">\(X =[0, 1] - \mathbb{Q}\)</span>, and a
continued fraction expansion <span class="math inline">\(x =[a_1(x),
a_2(x), \dotsc]\)</span>. Define the Gauss measure <span
class="math display">\[\mu_G(E) = \frac{1}{\log 2} \int_E \frac{d x}{1 +
x}.\]</span></p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 58</strong> (Galambos 1972). <em>For <span
class="math inline">\(r &gt; 0\)</span>, we have <span
class="math display">\[\mu_G \left( x \in X : \max_{1 \leq i \leq N}

    \xrightarrow{N \rightarrow \infty}
    e^{- \frac{1}{\log 2} \frac{1}{r}}.\]</span></em></p>
</div>
<p>Let’s think about what this tells us about continued fraction digits.
Take the fractional part of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\{\pi\} =[7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1,
\dotsc],\]</span> <span class="math display">\[a_{3 08} = 436, \qquad
  a_{432} = 20776,
  \qquad a_{28422} = 78629.\]</span> Those are the first six partial
maxima. It’s kind of clear that it’s a bit irregular when these maxima
happen, so it’s kind of difficult to predict when the next digit exceeds
the best previous one. If we pick a random number, we can ask for the
probability that the largest digit is <span class="math inline">\(\leq N
r\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is a parameter
that we can change according to whether we want to know whether we have
huge digits, small digits, etc. That’s an extreme value law. We will
discuss some examples like this in the context of dynamics.</p>
<p>We start with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>,
equipped with the hyperbolic metric <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. This gives rise to a hyperbolic area.
It is a model for hyperbolic geometry. There are certain curves of
constant curvature, the geodesics (half-circles). There are also the
horocycles, which hit the real axis in one point tangentially, and which
can be described using unipotent one-parameter subgroups of <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{R})\)</span>. As
dynamicists, we like to look at such curves. We should work in <span
class="math inline">\(T^1 \mathbb{H}\)</span>. We can look at the action
<span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{R})
\circlearrowright \mathbb{H}\)</span>, and form the quotient <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{H} /
{\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>. We can draw pictures of
dynamics on this.</p>
<p>We can also look at <span class="math inline">\(T^1(\mathbb{H} /
{\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z})) =: T^1 F\)</span>, which has a
volume measure <span class="math inline">\(\mu_L\)</span>. This thing is
non-compact but has finite volume, so we can normalize our measure to be
a probability measure.</p>
<p>[The speaker remembers the first time he saw the picture of a cusp,
which was when he was a master’s student in Aarhus; whenever he asked
Simon a question, he would draw this picture, which he would call the
“infinite Samosa”. Then he got a PhD position in the UK, so he learned
what Samosas were, then at Bristol he learned about the upper
half-plane, etc.]</p>
<p>The geodesic flow <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span> and
horocycle flow <span class="math inline">\(h_t\)</span> are both
ergodic. <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span> is fast mixing, while
<span class="math inline">\(h_t\)</span> is slow mixing.</p>
<p>If you want to understand cuspidal excursions, you could look at what
is called a logarithm law.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(\mu_L\)</span>-a.e. <span
class="math inline">\((z, v) \in T^1 F\)</span>, we have <span
class="math display">\[\limsup_{t \rightarrow \infty}
  \frac{d(\ast_t(z, v), \Im(z) = 1)}{\log t} = 1,\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\ast \in \{g, h\}\)</span>.</p>

  \end{cases}
\end{gathered}\]</span> The Pollicott proof of this uses the Galambos
result that we started with, because as some of you know, Caroline
Series and others proved back in the 80’s that there was a connection
between how geodesics cut through all these fundamental domains and the
continued fraction expansion of the endpoints. We chose to try a
different method. After all, one doesn’t have an analogue of continued
fractions for the horocycle flow. What you can do is take the unit
tangent bundle <span class="math inline">\(T^1 F\)</span> of the modular
surface and identify it with <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{R}) /
{\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>, which you can in turn
identify with <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{L}_2 = \left\{
\Lambda = \operatorname{span}_{\mathbb{Z}}(v_1, v_2) : v_1, v_2 \in
\mathbb{R}^2, \det(v_1, v_2) = 1 \right\},\]</span> the space of
unimodular lattices in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>. Under this identification,
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_L\)</span> corresponds to the
probability Haar measure. In this setting, we already mentioned that the
horocycle flow can be described by unipotent subgroups. The geodesic
flow can be described using diagonal matrices: <span
class="math display">\[g_t =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    e^t    &amp;  \\
           &amp; e^{- t} \\
  \end{pmatrix},
  \quad
  h_t =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1    &amp; t \\
    0 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{pmatrix},
  \quad
  h_t
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x    \\
    y  \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x + t y    \\
    y  \\
  \end{pmatrix}.\]</span> We have this thing called the Mahler
compactness criterion which says essentially that any compact subgroup
of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_2\)</span> avoids a
neighborhood of zero, i.e., that a cusp excursion is the same as <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> having a short vector. [Now I
learned yesterday that finding the shortest vector in a lattice is a
quantum hard problem, so don’t forget to be impressed here.] To measure
how far we are into the cusp, we define a function <span
class="math display">\[\alpha_1 : \mathcal{L}_2 \rightarrow
\mathbb{R},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\alpha_1(\Lambda) =
\log \sup_{v \in V} \frac{1}{\lVert V \rVert}.\]</span> (We should
remove <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> from our lattice each time
– let’s do that by convention.)</p>
<p>We look at <span class="math display">\[F_T(r) :=
  \mu \left( \Lambda \in \mathcal{L}_2: \max_{0 \leq t \leq \sigma}
    \alpha_1(h_t \Lambda)
    \leq \tfrac{1}{2} \log T + r
  \right).\]</span> We are now ready to state a theorem that Kevin and
the speaker were able to prove.</p>
<div class="theorem">

class="math display">\[C_0 e^{2 r} \leq F(r) \leq C_1 e^{2

</div>
<p>Marklof–Pollicott, August 2024: this <span
class="math inline">\(F_2\)</span> function continues to be the
distribution function up to <span class="math inline">\(- \log
2\)</span>, and then there is some further function <span
class="math inline">\(F_3\)</span> that takes over. Their method was
quite similar to that of Pollicott from his geodesic flow proof, whereas
ours takes place in this lattice setting. As far as possible, let’s
sketch a proof of the theorem. Actually, for the part where <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is positive, it is very simple, so we
can almost give the complete proof. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \left\{ \max_{0 \leq t \leq T} \alpha_1(h_t \Lambda) &gt; 0 r +

class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in view of our assumption <span
class="math inline">\(r &gt; 0\)</span>. Thus the number of relevant
lattice points is at most one, and we can rewrite the above as <span

\emptyset}.\]</span> We have <span
class="math display">\[\begin{gathered}
  \mu \left( \Lambda \cap I_r^+ \neq \emptyset \right) = \int

  \\
  = \frac{1}{\zeta(2)}
  \int \mathbf{1}_{I_r^+} \, d \mathrm{Leb}
  =
  \frac{6}{\pi^2} \frac{1}{2} e^{- 2 r} = \frac{3}{\pi^2} e^{- 2 r}.

<p>How about the rest of the theorem? Well, decreasing <span

have more points. You add to the above characteristic function (of

<p>We’ll start with a cusp form <span class="math inline">\(f :
\mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}\)</span>, satisfying some
transformation behavior with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>. It comes with
a Fourier expansion <span id="eq:cnrbw4dnun" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnrbw4dnun}\tag{13.1}
  f(z) = \sum a_f(n) e^{2 \pi i n z}.\]</span> It is common to consider
with this cusp form simultaneously the associated <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function <span
class="math display">\[L(s, f) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{a_f(n)}{
n^s}.\]</span> Its <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function is
also a generating series with the same coefficients, but somehow with
different weight functions. If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
comes from an automorphic form, then the <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function has a functional equation,
which is a reflection of the fact that <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> itself has so many functional equations
under <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>.</p>
<p>A converse theorem is the converse of this: given an <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function with a functional equation,
does it come from an automorphic form? Equivalently, if <span
class="math inline">\(L(s, f)\)</span> satisfies a functional equation,
must the series <a href="#eq:cnrbw4dnun" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnrbw4dnun">\((13.1)\)</a> be modular? More
generally, what properties of the sequence <span
class="math inline">\(a_f(n)\)</span> are needed for <a
href="#eq:cnrbw4dnun" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnrbw4dnun">\((13.1)\)</a> to be modular?</p>
<p>The first converse theorem is due ot Hecke (1936). It says that if
you have an <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function <span
class="math display">\[L(s, f) = \sum \frac{a(n)}{ n^s}\]</span> that
has a functional equation with conductor <span class="math inline">\(N =
1\)</span> (and the right <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-factors, and some regularity
conditions), then the corresponding Fourier series <a
href="#eq:cnrbw4dnun" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnrbw4dnun">\((13.1)\)</a> is a modular form (or
even a cusp form, if there is no pole) for <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>.</p>
<p>At first sight, this is maybe unexpected, because being a cusp form
requires infinitely many functional equations, one for each group
element in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>, whereas for
the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function, you have only one.
But if you think about this for a moment, this is almost immediate. The
key observation is that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)</span> is generated by
two elements: <span class="math display">\[\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) =
\left\langle
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1      &amp; 1 \\
             &amp; 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}
      &amp; -1 \\
      1 &amp;  \\
    \end{pmatrix}\right\rangle.\]</span> Modularity with respect to the
first generator holds for any series, so you only have to check it for
the second, which corresponds to the functional equation. But this
argument does not generalize to congruence subgroups.</p>
<p>The mathematical community had to weight <span
class="math inline">\(30\)</span> years to see the general version of
this, due to Weil (1967), in a paper written in German on the occasion
of Hecke’s birthday. This general version is not so hard to prove;
somehow the key fact is that you have to come up with the right theorem.
You have to consider the functional equation not just for <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, but also all its twists by Dirichlet
characters <span class="math inline">\(\chi :(\mathbb{Z} / q
\mathbb{Z})^\ast \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[L(s, f \times \chi) = \sum \frac{a(n) \chi(n)}{
n^s}.\]</span> If these have the correct functional equation for all (or
sufficiently many) Dirichlet characters, then <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a cusp form for a congruence
subgroup.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of research to make this a little sharper and
find criteria for precisely which twists you actually need, but we don’t
want to talk about this.</p>
<div class="remark">
<p><strong>Remark 65</strong>. These twists by Dirichlet characters can
be replaced by twists with additive characters <span
class="math display">\[\mathbb{Z} / q \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow
\mathbb{C}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[n \mapsto e^{2 \pi i n
\tfrac{a}{q}}.\]</span> There is not a big difference between them,
since one can pass from one to the other via Gauss sums, without losing
information. Why are we saying this? Well, the functional equation of
these <em>twisted</em> <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions,
when you think of the twist as a twist by an <em>additive</em>
character, is what is called <em>Voronoi summation</em>. The slogan is
that a functional equation of the form <span class="math display">\[\sum
a(n) e^{2 \pi i n \tfrac{a}{q}} \rightsquigarrow \sum a(n) e^{- 2 \pi i
n \tfrac{\bar{a}}{q}}\]</span> is called a Voronoi summation formula,
and modularity is thus equivalent to all Voronoi summation formulas.</p>
</div>
<p>Why do we care? One motivation is that this approach can perhaps be
used to prove instances of functoriality. What is functoriality? It’s a
big part of the Langlands program. The basic idea is that if I give you
a modular form, there are certain ways to produce new modular forms out
of old modular forms. This is like in linear algebra, where you have
ways to create new vector spaces out of old ones. The idea is that
something similar should hold for modular forms. Maybe you have some
control over the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions for
the modular forms that you’re trying to produce. Converse theorems would
then be useful for using that control to establish modularity. This is a
huge theory that we’ll illustrate with a simple example:</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 66</strong>. Suppose we’re given an automorphic form
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_2\)</span>, with its standard
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function. You can create out of
this a new <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function, called the
symmetric square <span class="math display">\[L(s, f) = \sum
\frac{a_f(n)}{ n^s} \rightsquigarrow
    L(s, {\mathop{\mathrm{sym}}}^2 f) \approx \sum \frac{a_f(n^2)}{
n^s}.\]</span> Suppose you can show that this has a functional equation
of the expected type and nice properties. Can you conclude from this
that the automorphic form having the indicated numbers <span
class="math inline">\(a_f(n^2)\)</span> as Fourier coefficients is an
automorphic form on <span
class="math inline">\({\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}}_3\)</span>? The answer is
“yes”. Typically these instances of functoriality are most easily
described on the level of <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions, so it would be nice to have
a way to go from the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function
back to the automorphic form. A converse theorem can be useful to prove
automorphicity or modularity in such instances.</p>
</div>
<p>Functoriality is widely open. There have been many ideas for how to
attack it in certain situations. From the perspective of analytic number
theory, one of the most attractive ideas goes back to Langlands and has
the fancy name “beyond endoscopy”. (It’s called this because for a long
time, people tried using endoscopic with some success, but couldn’t
prove anything; Langlands had the vision that there was perhaps
something “beyond” endoscopy.) The idea of functoriality is that you
want to produce new automorphic forms, called <em>functorial lifts</em>,
out of old automorphic forms. These should be characterized by poles of
certain <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions. So if you’re
given a big back of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_3\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions and want to see which
are lifts from other groups and pick one of them, you should be able to
see this when you study a certain <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function. The latter should either have
a pole or not have a pole, from which you can read off whether it is or
is not such a lift. Let’s give the easiest possible example:</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 67</strong>. Take a quadratic number field <span
class="math inline">\(K / \mathbb{Q}\)</span>, and a Hecke character
<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>. By taking a theta series
(“automorphic induction”), you get a cusp form <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{AI}(\chi)\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_2\)</span>. How can you check when a
cusp form comes from a theta series in this way? They are characterized
by the following fact: <span class="math inline">\(L(s,
{\mathop{\mathrm{sym}}}^2(\mathrm{AI}(\chi)))\)</span> has a pole at <span
class="math inline">\(s = 1\)</span>. This is the simplest example. Now,
how can you use poles to characterize lifts? If any <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function has a pole at <span
class="math inline">\(s =1\)</span>, this means the coefficients all
point in the same direction, without cancellation. So what you can do is
take your cusp form <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, take its
symmetric square, and just add up the coefficients for <span
class="math inline">\(n \leq X\)</span>, normalize the sum, and take the
limit: <span class="math display">\[\lim_{X \rightarrow \infty}
\frac{1}{X} \sum_{n \leq X} a_f(n^2).\]</span> This should be roughly
the indicator function on lifts: roughly <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> according as there is or is not a pole.
In order to establish the characterization, you can average this over
all <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, which should be the same as
averaging the same thing over all lifts. You can compute both averages
explicitly using some sort of trace formula (for all cusp forms, and
only for lifts). You can compare the two averages by comparing two trace
formulas; in the end, you should get the same result. This establishes
the characterization “on average”. By introducing weights, we can then
recover the characterization for individual lifts. This has been worked
out in detail in Venkatesh’s thesis.</p>
</div>
<p>You can use a small variation of this idea to prove converse
theorems. Remember what we want to show: we want to show that if some
sequence <span class="math inline">\(b(n)\)</span> satisfies all Voronoi
summation formulae, then we can deduce modularity. How can we see that a
sequence <span class="math inline">\(b(n)\)</span> is modular? If this
<span class="math inline">\(b(n)\)</span> happens to be some modular
form <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that we know already, then
there is no cancellation in the sum <span
class="math display">\[\frac{1}{X} \sum_{n \leq X} b(n) a_f(n).\]</span>
If it is not a modular form, then it shouldn’t resonate with any such
<span class="math inline">\(a_f(n)\)</span>, and there should be lots of
cancellation and we should get zero. Thus, averaging over <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we should get an expression that
detects when <span class="math inline">\(b(n)\)</span> describes a lift.
By interchanging summation and using a trace formula, we can see that
<span class="math display">\[\sum_f \frac{1}{X} \sum_{n \leq X} b(n)
a_f(n)
  \approx
  \frac{1}{X}
  \sum_{n \leq X} b(n)
  \sum_c S(n, 1, c),\]</span> where the Kloosterman sum is defined by
<span id="eq:cnrbw6p2zj" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnrbw6p2zj}\tag{13.2}
  S(n, 1, c) = \sum_{d \pmod{c}} e^{2 \pi i \frac{n d +
\bar{d}}{c}}.\]</span> By opening this last definition and interchanging
summation again, we are faced with the sums <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{n \leq X} b(n) e^{2 \pi i n d/c}\)</span>,
to which we can apply the assumed Voronoi summation formula. That’s the
idea behind the argument.</p>
<p>This argument is fairly global, but has some important local inputs.
You need the following inversion formula. Take a test function <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, and integrate it against a Bessel
kernel: <span class="math display">\[\int
  \left( \int h(t) \frac{J_{2 i t}(x)}{ \cosh(\pi t)}
    t \, d t \right)
  \frac{J_{2 i s}(x)}{\cosh(\pi s)}
  \, \frac{d x}{x}
  = h(s).\]</span> This is called the Sears–Titchmarsh transform.</p>
<p>Let’s now discuss the case of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_3\)</span>. Converse theorems in that
setting are well known. They concern the question: given a sequence of
numbers, when can we conclude that they are Hecke eigenvalues for a
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_3\)</span> form? The first
converse theorem goes back to Piatetski-Shapiro (1979).
Goldfeld–Thillainetesan (2003) and Miller–Schmid (2006) gave other
proofs. The theorem says that the functional equation of <span
class="math inline">\(L(s, f \times \chi)\)</span> for all Dirichlet
characters <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> (or equivalently,
all Voronoi summation formulae) imply modularity on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_3\)</span>.</p>
<div class="remark">
<p><strong>Remark 68</strong>. You would hope this continues
indefinitely on <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_n\)</span>, but
unfortunately that’s not the case – more is needed than just character
twists when <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 4\)</span>.
Piatetski-Shapiro and Cogdell showed that we can get by <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{GL}}(m)\)</span> twists for all
<span class="math inline">\(m \leq n - 2\)</span>; the conjecture is
that it suffices to take <span class="math inline">\(m \leq
\tfrac{n}{2}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>We present a further proof of the same theorem for <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_3\)</span>:</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 69</strong> (Blomer–Leung). <em>Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(b(n)\)</span> satisfies all Voronoi summation
formulas. Then <span class="math inline">\(b(n)\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>-modular.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="proof"><p>
<a href="#" class="toggle-proof"><em data-default-text="Sketch of proof." data-folded-text="Sketch of proof. (...)">Sketch of proof.</em></a>
<span class="proof-content"> It’s similar to what we described for <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_2\)</span>, but more complicated. We
take our sequence, and want to see whether it resonates in the
expression <span class="math display">\[\sum_f \frac{1}{X} \sum_{n \leq
X} b(n) a_f(n).\]</span> We interchange summation and use some <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_3\)</span> trace formula. This gives
rise to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_3\)</span> Kloosterman
sums. These are again exponential sums, although more complicated than
<a href="#eq:cnrbw6p2zj" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnrbw6p2zj">\((13.2)\)</a>. You can then apply
the Voronoi summation, which gives more exponential sums. These have
some special shape that can be transformed in a certain way that is
called <em>reciprocity</em>. They are then in a new shape, and you can
apply the Voronoi summation formula again. Then you can evaluate what
you want. ◻</p>
</span></div>
<div class="remark">
<p><strong>Remark 70</strong>. We emphasized that we need some local
input for this. The local input for <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_2\)</span> was the Sears–Titchmarsh
transform: you need to show that the Kuznetsov kernel, integrated
against twice the Voronoi kernel and the reciprocity kernel, are
inverses of each other. This would take several blackboards to write
down, so we won’t; let’s just say that it needs a <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_3\)</span> integral inversion
formula.</p>
</div>
<div class="remark">
<p><strong>Remark 71</strong>. Here’s the speculative part. The Voronoi
formula is associated with <span class="math display">\[\begin{pmatrix}

to the Voronoi, reciprocity and Voronoi applications. Maybe the integral

<p><strong>Remark 72</strong>. The non-archimedean part consists of many

realize that this fails immediately. Why? Well, you could try the same
thing, but the moment you apply Voronoi to the exponential sums, you get
something that is essentially self-dual, so you can’t go further. We
could have guessed this in advance, because we know that Voronoi formula
alone don’t do the job – you also need <span

this. Take <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>, a primitive
character modulo <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, and take <span
class="math inline">\(N, M \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>, and and <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon&gt; 0\)</span>. Then <span
class="math display">\[\sum_{n = M + 1}^{M + N} \chi(n)
\ll_\varepsilon\sqrt{N} q^{3/16 + \varepsilon}.\]</span> There’s this
version due to Jain–Sharma, Khade, Liu (2021): if our character is
primitive, then for <span id="eq:cnrbxdflam" class="math display">\[\label{eq:cnrbxdflam}\tag{14.1}
  q \geq e^{e^{9.594}},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\left|
\sum_{n = M + 1}^{M + N} \chi(n) \right| \leq \sqrt{N} q^{3/16} \left(
\dotsb \right),\]</span> where the omitted part involves <span
class="math inline">\(\log \log\)</span>’s, etc. The bound <a
href="#eq:cnrbxdflam" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq:cnrbxdflam">\((14.1)\)</a> is not so useful for
computations, but we can make the asymptotic growth of the estimate
worse, say <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{N} q^{\frac{m - 1}{4
m}}\)</span>, but with a weaker lower bound for <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. We
consider sequences <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2
\geq \dotsb \geq \lambda_r\)</span> of positive integeres such that
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1 + \dotsb + \lambda_r = n\)</span>.
We call such a tuple <span class="math inline">\(\lambda =(\lambda_1,
\dotsc, \lambda_r)\)</span> a <em>partition</em> of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. The total number of partitions is
denoted <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span>. For example, <span
class="math inline">\(p(4) = 5\)</span>. We adopt the convention <span
class="math inline">\(p(0) = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>To calculate the number <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span>, we
need to determine the number of solutions in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}_0^n\)</span> of the Diophantine
equation <span class="math display">\[X_1 + 2 X_2 + \dotsb + n X_n =
0.\]</span> This is a challenging combinatorial problem. Numerical
observations show the rapid growth of <span
class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span>.</p>
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 79</strong>. Can we describe this growth in a simple
way?</p>
</div>
<p>We use Euler’s identity: <span class="math display">\[\sum_{n \geq 0}
p(n) q^n = \prod_{n \geq 1} \frac{1}{1 - q^n}
  = \frac{q^{1/24}}{ \eta(z)},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(q = e^{2 \pi i z}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\eta(z)\)</span> is the Dedekind eta function. The
right hand side is thus essentially a weakly holomorphic modular form of
weight <span class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 80</strong>. When and, if so, how can we derive
exact formulas or at least the asymptotic growth behavior of a sequence
<span class="math inline">\(a(n)\)</span> from its power series <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{n \geq 0} a(n) q^n\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>First answers</strong>. “When” is not clearly determinable
(at most, sufficient criteria exist). However, in the case of “how”,
there is an “obvious” methodology: the <em>circle method</em>!</p>
<p>The idea of the circle method is to use the analytical properties of
the function <span class="math inline">\(F(q) := \sum_{n \geq 0} a(n)
q^n\)</span> generated bya sequence <span
class="math inline">\(a(n)\)</span> to gain information about <span
class="math inline">\(a(n)\)</span>. Cauchy’s integral formula <span
class="math display">\[a(n) = \oint_{\lvert q \rvert = r_n}
\frac{F(q)}{q^{n + 1}} \, \frac{d q}{2 \pi i},\]</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; r_n &lt; 1\)</span>. Alternatively, with
the variable substitution <span class="math inline">\(q := e^{2 \pi i(x
+ i y)}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(y &gt; 0\)</span>), <span
class="math display">\[a(n) = e^{2 \pi n y_n} \int_0^1 F(e^{x + i y_n})
e^{- 2 \pi i n x} \, d x.\]</span> Remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The RHS depends essentially only on <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>!</p></li>
<li><p>The free choice of <span class="math inline">\(y_n &gt;
0\)</span> helps in potentially precisely estimating the integral. (Take
<span class="math inline">\(y_n \rightarrow 0\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(n \rightarrow \infty\)</span>.)</p></li>
<li><p>The growth behavior of <span class="math inline">\(F(q)\)</span>
as <span class="math inline">\(\lvert q \rvert \rightarrow 1^-\)</span>
is decisive for the growth of <span
class="math inline">\(a(n)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The idea now is to split the integral into two parts by dividing the
circle into two arcs: the <em>major arcs</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span> and the <em>minor arcs</em>
<span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[a(n) =
  \oint_{\lvert q \rvert = r_n} \frac{F(q)}{q^{n + 1}} \, \frac{d q}{2
\pi i}
  =
  \oint_{\mathfrak{M}} \frac{F(q)}{q^{n + 1}} \, \frac{d q}{2 \pi i}
  + \oint_{\mathfrak{m}} \frac{F(q)}{q^{n + 1}} \, \frac{d q}{2 \pi
i},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M} \cup
\mathfrak{m} = \partial B_{r_n}(0)\)</span>. The ideal case is when
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is provably large and
controllable on the major arcs and negligible on the minor arcs, giving
rise respectively to main and error terms.</p>
<p>[Picture of disc model of hyperbolic plane showing a function where
we can see how the pole at <span class="math inline">\(q = 1\)</span>

<p>With this method, Hardy and Ramanujan were able to prove the
following:</p>
<div id="theorem:cnrbxgr03s" class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 81</strong> (Hardy–Ramanujan 1917). <em>For <span

class="math display">\[p(n) \sim \frac{1}{4 \sqrt{3} n}
    e^{\pi \sqrt{2 n /3}}.\]</span></em></p>

<p>Their result connects partitions with fundamental constants.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: generalize the result of Hardy and Ramanujan
to the largest possible family of sequences <span
class="math inline">\(a(n)\)</span>, using the circle method. We call
such a sequence of “partition type” if the following holds:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p><span id="enumerate:cnrbxgyeoc"
label="enumerate:cnrbxgyeoc"></span> There exists an induced sequence of
integer exponents <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> such that
there is a product identity <span class="math display">\[F(q) := \sum_{n
\geq 0} a(n) q^n = \prod_{n \geq 1}
    \frac{1}{(1 - q^n)^{f(n)}}.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><span id="enumerate:cnrbxgyhfl"
label="enumerate:cnrbxgyhfl"></span> The exponents <span
class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> grow at most polynomially, and in
particular, subexponentially, i.e., <span

circle.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="enumerate:cnrbxgx9oa"
label="enumerate:cnrbxgx9oa"></span> The exponents must satisfy <span
class="math inline">\(f(n) \geq 0\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(n \geq 0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 83</strong>. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The partition function is <em>naturally of partition type</em>,
taking <span class="math inline">\(f = 1\)</span>.</p></li>

</div>
<p>How to approach functions of partition type? <strong>Main
idea</strong>: consider the exponents in our product, and utilize, if
available, “good analytical proeprties” of the Dirichlet series <span
class="math inline">\(L_f(s) := \sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{f(n)}{
n^s}\)</span>. (In the classical partition function, with <span
class="math inline">\(f \equiv 1\)</span>, we get the Riemann zeta
function.) We then aim to get information about <span
class="math inline">\(a(n)\)</span> from information about <span
class="math inline">\(L_f\)</span>. This was already applied in the
classical article by Meinardus (1954).</p>
<p><strong>Problems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Meinardus requires technical analytical assumptions about the
function <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{n \geq 1} f(n) q^n\)</span>,
which makes it difficult to apply in practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Primarily produces a main term, so no optimization of the error
term is possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: remove technical assumptions and replace them
with much simpler conditions, without significantly weakening the
theorem (de Brujin and Tenenbaum, 2020).</p>
<p>We complete the Dirichlet series, giving <span
class="math display">\[L_f^\ast(s) := \Gamma(s) \zeta(s + 1)
L_f(s).\]</span> We impose some conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>All poles of <span class="math inline">\(L_f\)</span> are real,
which means in practice that for each prime, <span
class="math inline">\(f(n) \neq 0\)</span> for sufficiently many <span
class="math inline">\(n \not \equiv 0 \pmod{p}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuation and good pole distribution, e.g., no non-real poles,
and all simple except possibly at <span class="math inline">\(s =
0\)</span> where we allow a double pole.</p></li>
<li><p>Nice growth behavior on vertical strips (majorized by <span
class="math inline">\(e^{a \lvert t \rvert}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(a &lt; \pi/2\)</span>, uniformly on vertical
strips).</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 84</strong> (Main theorem). <em>Let <span
class="math inline">\(p_f\)</span> be of parittion type, with <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{n \geq 0} p_f(n) q^n = \prod_{n \geq 1}(1 -
q^n)^{- f(n)}\)</span>. Assume the above conditions. Then we get an
asymptotic formula, explicitly calculated in terms of residues of <span
class="math inline">\(L_f^\ast\)</span> at poles: <span
class="math display">\[p_f(n) = \frac{C}{ n^b} \exp \left( A_1
n^{\frac{\alpha}{ \alpha + 1}} + \sum_{j = 2}^M A_j n^{a_j} \right)

\operatorname{O}_{L, R}(^{- \min \left\{ \frac{2 L - \alpha}{2(\alpha +
1)}, \frac{R}{\alpha + 1} \right\}}) \right).\]</span></em></p>

<p>We briefly indicate some applications: to partitions (including plane
partitions and partitions into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th
powers), applications in algebra to various Lie algebras and
representation theory, generalizing to other possible groups (coming
from Witten zeta functions), some involvement of multivariable zeta
functions of Matsumoto, applications to symmetric group theory
concerning the counts of commuting <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>-tuples in <span
class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> using some classical formula of
Bryan–Fulman, etc.</p>
<p>Q. why no apparent oscillation in the main theorem, cf. Mahler? A:
that’s a different problem.</p>
